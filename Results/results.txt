The
University
of
Windsor
is
a
comprehensive

student-focused
university

with
more
than
16
000
students
enrolled
in
a
broad
range
of
undergraduate
and
graduate
programs

including

Law

Engineering
Science
Education
Nursing
Human
Kinetics
Social
Work
Faculty
of
Art

Humanities

and
Social
Sciences
We
have
strong
student-faculty
relationships

exceptional
award-winning
faculty
and
innovative
staff

It
creates
a
unifying
atmosphere
of
excellence
across
all
of
our
faculties
to
encourage
lifelong
learning

teaching

research
and
discovery

The
University
of
Windsor
also
ushered
in
a
new
era
in
September
2015
with
the
opening
of
classes
at
the
first
phase
of
its
downtown
campus
in
the
heart
of
Windsorâ€™s
core

The
new
buildingâ€”which
retains
the
historic
facade
of
the
former
Windsor
Star
newspaper
buildingâ€”houses
the
School
of
Social
Work
and
Continuing
Education

The
second
phase
of
the
downtown
campus
includes
the
School
of
Creative
Arts

located
in
the
century-old
site
of
the
Windsor
Armouries
and
the
Alan
Wildeman
Centre
for
Creative
Arts

The
University
of
Windsor
is
located
next
to
North
Americaâ€™s
busiest
international
border
crossing
and
looks
out
on
one
of
Canadaâ€™s
most
beautiful
waterfronts
on
the
Detroit
River

Windsor
is
also
Canadaâ€™s
southernmost
city
and
has
some
of
the
countryâ€™s
best
weather

This
location
speaks
to
UWindsorâ€™s
strength
as
an
internationally
oriented

multi-disciplined
institution
that
actively
enables
a
broad
diversity
of
students

faculty
and
staff
to
make
a
better
world
through
education

scholarship

research
and
engagement

Its
basic
characteristics
of
openness

warmth

and
support
make
the
University
of
Windsor
an
exceptionally
welcoming
community
for
students
and
faculty
from
Asia

Europe
and
Africaâ€”or
from
just
down
the
street

The
University
receives
revenues
from
a
variety
of
different
sources
all
across
campus

Revenue
is
recorded
in
the
system
in
4
ways
depending
mainly
on
materiality
 
For
the
most
part

each
department
is
responsible
for
recording
their
revenue
whether
that
be
through
an
integrated
system

a
deposit
summary
form

an
invoice
request

a
deposit
form
or
a
journal
entry

Here
are
the
4
ways
Revenue
is
Recorded

Invoices
The
first
way
that
revenue
is
recorded
is
through
an
invoice

This
is
by
far
the
most
preferred
method
for
a
variety
of
reasons

Invoice
forms
should
be
filled
out
in
their
entirety
and
sent
to
ARINV@uwindsor
ca

They
can
be
found
under
AR
Invoice
Request

Research
invoicing
is
sent
to
RESINV@uwindsor
ca
and
should
always
be
sent
to
research
finance
prior
to
sending
to
Accounts
Receivable

The
main
reasons
why
finance
and
your
departments
should
prefer
recording
revenue
through
an
invoice
are

Your
department
receives
the
revenue
in
their
account
as
soon
as
it
is
invoiced
so
you
do
not
have
to
await
payment
before
recording
the
revenue
Follow-up
for
payment
resides
within
the
A/R
department
and
Finance
(unless
additional
support
is
required
and
you
will
be
notified
as
such)
Most
cheques
and
payments
come
directly
to
finance
so
there
is
no
delay
in
the
University
trying
to
apply
payment
to
a
department
they
are
unaware
is
owed
the
money

The
Accounts
Receivable
system
allows
for
more
detailed
information
for
you
and
better
means
of
reporting
for
the
University
as
a
whole

It
is
increasingly
necessary
to
have
accurate
records
of
revenue
received
due
to
our
SMA3
government
funding
metrics

NOTE

It
is
very
important
that
any
invoicing
done
by
ANY
department
at
the
University
be
recorded
through
Accounts
Receivable

There
should
NEVER
be
an
invoice
sent
to
an
external
party
on
behalf
of
the
University
of
Windsor
outside
of
UWinsite
Finance
and
the
A/R
department

Receipts
The
second
way
revenue
is
recorded
is
through
processing
a
receipt
 
This
is
done
when
you
are
receiving
a
cheque and
have
not
previously
invoiced

You
may
receive
cheques
for
a
variety
of
payments
 
Depending
on
your
monthly
volume
of
revenues

you
may
have
been
issued
a
deposit
summary
form
by
the
finance
department
to
be
sent
weekly
to
Accounts
Receivable

If
you
receive
cheques
infrequently
or
smaller
amounts
(below
$10
000
per
month)

you
are
required
to
send
the
money
to
Accounts
Receivable
along
with
a
filled
out
Deposit
form
 
This
can
be
found under Deposit
Funds
 
All
non-cash
deposits
can
be
sent
the
Accounts
Receivable

CHT
4th Floor

Any
cheques
you
receive
that
youâ€™ve
sent
an
invoice
request
in
can
simply
be
forwarded
to
Accounts
Receivable
 
No
forms
are
necessary

Any
cheques
exceeding
$10
000
will
also
be
recorded
as
an
invoice
for
reporting
purposes

NOTE

For
everyoneâ€™s
safety

please
do
not
send
cash
through
inter-office
mail
 Please
note
our Cash
Handling
Policy if
you
have
any
questions
or
concerns

Journal
Entry
or
Deposit
Summary
The
third
way
to
record
revenue
is
through
a
journal
entry
or
deposit
summary
 
This
would
apply
to
those
departments
that
have
applied
for
their
own
deposit
forms
with
brinks
night
deposit
bags
and/or
have
their
own
POS
machines
 
Your
deposit
will
be
done
through
a
deposit
summary
(which
finance
would
provide)
if
the
volume
of
revenue
exceeds
$10
000
per
month
on
average
 
Otherwise

for
each
deposit
form
a
journal
entry
form
will
need

All
research
and
teaching
at
the
University
of
Windsor
involving
the
use
of
animals
(including
fish
and
invertebrates)

whether
laboratory
or
field-based

must
receive
approval
from
the
Animal
Care
Committee
(ACC)
before
such
research
or
teaching
begins

The
mandate
of
the
ACC
is
to
ensure
that
all
research
with
animals
is
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
highest
ethical
and
humane
standards
and
that
the
animals

the
public

the
researchers

and
the
University
of
Windsor
are
all
protected
from
harm

All
ACC
policies
and
procedures
are
designed
to
comply
with
those
of
the
Canadian
Council
on
Animal
Care
(CCAC)

All
personnel
who
will
be
involved
in
the
use
of
animals
in
research
(as
indicated
on
the
AUPP
form)
must
demonstrate
an
understanding
of
the
principles
and
theory
required
for
vertebrate
animal-based
studies

 Toward
this
objective
the
ACC
has
developed
an
On-Line
Theory
Course
composed
of
14
modules
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
ACC
and
CCAC
before
beginning
work
with
vertebrate
animals

 Individuals
needing
to
take
this
training
course
should
read
the
Introductory
Module
(see
listings
to
the
left
on
the
home
page)
to
determine
the
modules
to
be
read
to
receive
a
Certificate
of
Good
Animal
Practice
before
proceeding
work
with
animals

The
Online
Course
is

From

place
youÂ can
trust

For
over
a
decade

the
AppÂ Store
has
proved
to
be
a
safe
andÂ trusted
place
to
discover
andÂ download
apps

But
the
AppÂ Store
is
more
than
just
a
storefront
â€”
itâ€™s
an
innovative
destination
focused
on
bringing
you
amazing
experiences

And
a
big
part
of
those
experiences
is
ensuring
that
the
apps
we
offer
are
held
to
the
highest
standards
for
privacy

security

and
content

Because
we
offer
nearly
two
million
apps
â€”
and
we
want
you
to
feel
good
about
using

purchase
a
new
Mac

iPhone

iPad

or
Apple

weâ€™ll
arrange
for

and
verify
its

checks
out

card

weâ€™ll

via

Regardless
of
how
you
choose
to
trade
in

if
the
condition
of
your
device
doesnâ€™t
match
what
you
described

a
new
estimated
trade-in
value
will
be
provided

Youâ€™ll
have
the
option
to
either
accept

or
reject
it

If
you
reject
it

your
device
will
be
returned
to
you
at
no
charge

Should
I
choose
credit
toward
a
purchase
or
an
Apple
Store
Gift
Card?
It
depends
on
where
and
when
you
make
a
purchase

If
youâ€™re
ready
to
buy
a
new
product
at
an
Apple
Store

you
can
bring
your
old
device
with
you

If
itâ€™s
eligible
for
trade-in

weâ€™ll
apply
an
instant
credit
at
the
time
of
purchase

If
youâ€™re
ready
to
buy
a
new
Apple
product
online
(apple
com
(Opens
in
a
new
window)
or
the
Apple
Store
app)

you
can
trade
in
an
old
device
and
get
credit
toward
your
purchase

If
youâ€™re
not
ready
to
make
a
purchase

you
can
trade
in
your
old
device
online
for
an
Apple
Gift
Card
via
email
that
you
can
apply
to
any
future
Apple
purchase

And
no
matter
how
you
use
Apple
Trade
In

if
your
device
has
no
trade-in
value

you
can
always
recycle
it
responsibly
for
free

How
long
does
the
online
trade-in
process
take?
Generally
it
takes
2â€“3
weeks

But
the
sooner
we
receive
your
device

the
sooner
we
can
verify
its
condition
and
process
your
credit
or
gift
card

Recycling
a
device
is
much
faster

As
soon
as
we
email
you
a
prepaid
shipping
label

just
send
your
device
to
our
recycling
partner

If
I
buy
a
new
device
online
with
a
trade-in

what
kind
of
credit
will
I
get?
It
depends
on
what
you
buy
and
how
you
pay
for
it

If
you
buy
an
iPhone

iPad

Mac

or
Apple
Watch
and
pay
in
full

weâ€™ll
apply
a
credit
to
your
original
payment
method
up
to
the
total
purchase
price

For
any
remaining
amount

youâ€™ll
receive
an
Apple
Gift
Card
via
email

If
you
buy
an
iPhone
using
Apple
Card
Monthly
Installments

Apple
iPhone
Payments

or
the
Verizon
Device
Payment
Program
and
include
a
trade-in

your
estimated
trade-in
credit
will
be
applied
directly
to
the
purchase
price
of
your
new
iPhone

Once
we
receive
your
trade-in
device
and
confirm
that
the
condition
matches
what
you
described

thereâ€™s
nothing
more
you
need
to
do

If
it
doesnâ€™t
match

your
original
payment
method
will
be
charged
the
difference
in
value

In
that
case

weâ€™ll
work
with
you
to
confirm
that
you
still
want
to
move
forward
with
the
trade-in

Can
I
see
what
my
device
is
worth
online

then
bring
it
with
me
when
I
buy
a
new
device
in
the
store?
Yes

the
Apple
Trade
In
program
is
available
on
apple

(Opens

a
new
window)
as
well
as
in
all
our
retail
stores

However

keep
in
mind
that
the
trade-in
credit
you
get
in
the
store
may
be
different
from
the
estimated
trade-in
value
you
received
online

How
much
will
I
get
for
my
trade-in?
It
depends
on
the
device

model

manufacturer

and
condition

Answer
a
few
questions
accurately

and
once
we
receive
the
device
within
the
specified
time
frame
and
verify
its
condition

youâ€™ll
most

receive
the
full
amount

the
estimated
refund

mind
that
we
need
to
receive
your

the
trade-in

the
condition
needs
to
match
what
you
told
us

If
the
condition
of
the
device
is
different
from
what
you
described

provide
a
revised
value

can
either
accept
or
reject
it

If
you
accept
it

weâ€™ll
continue
with
the
trade-in
and
either
charge
or
credit
the
difference
in
value
to
the
card
you
provided

If
you
reject
it

weâ€™ll
cancel
the
trade-in

return
your
current
device

and
charge
the
original
trade-in
value
to
your
card

matter
what

weâ€™ll
send
you
email
updates
about

Times
bestselling
Dismas
Hardy
series
returns
with
this
â€œperfect
piece
of
entertainment
from
a
master
storytellerâ€?
(Steve
Berry

New
York
Times
bestselling
author)
about
a
relentlessly
twisty
murder
mystery

No
one
mourned
when
San
Francisco
DA
Wes
Farrell
put
Paul
Riley
in
prison
eleven
years
ago
for
the
rape
and
murder
of
his
girlfriend

And
no
one
is
particularly
happy
to
see
him
again
when
heâ€™s
released
after
The
Exoneration
Initiative
uncovered
evidence
that
pinned
the
crime
on
someone
else

In
fact

Riley
soon
turns
up
murdered

surrounded
by
the
loot
from
his
latest
scam

But
if
Riley
was
really
innocent
all
along

who
wanted
him
dead?
To
the
cops

itâ€™s
straightforward

the
still-grieving
father
of
Rileyâ€™s
dead
girlfriend
killed

former

Farrell

now
out

and
practicing

with
master

Dismas
Hardy

agrees
to
represent
the
defendant

Doug
Rushâ€”and
is
left
in
the
dust
when
Rush
suddenly
vanishes

At
a
loss

Farrell
and
Hardy
ask
PI
Abe
Glitsky
to
track
down
the
potentially
lethal
defendant

The
search
takes
Glitsky
through
an
investigative
hall
of
mirrors
populated
by
wounded
parents

crooked
cops

cheating
spouses

and
single-minded
vigilantes

As
Glitsky
embraces
and
then
discards
one
enticing
theory
after
another

the
truth
seems
to
recede
ever
farther

So
far
that
he
begins
to

his
own
moral
compass
in

Bestselling
novelist
Sara
Medlar
is
skilled
at
sharing
stories
about
other
people

but
she
hoped
the
truth
about
her
own
family
would
never
surface

Her
home
in
Lachlan

Florida

is
her

and
she
loves
having
her
niece
Kate
and
dear

Jack
Wyatt
together
under

The

have
sworn
off
getting
involved
in

When

properly
introducing
us
to
one
of
the
most
explosive

formative
voices
of
our
time

Gadsby
grew
upÂ as
the
youngest
of
five
childrenÂ in
an
isolated
town
in
Tasmania

whereÂ homosexuality
was
illegal
until
1997

She
perceived
her
childhood
as
safe
and
â€œnormal
â€?
but
as
she
gained
an
awareness
of
her
burgeoning
queerness

the
outside
world
began
to
undermine
the
â€œvulnerably
thin
veneerâ€?
of
her
existence

After
moving
to
mainland
Australia
and
receiving
aÂ degreeÂ in
art
history

Gadsby
found
herself
adrift

working
itinerant
jobs

enduring
years
of
isolation
punctuated
by
homophobic
and
sexual
violence

At
age
twenty-seven

without
a
home
or
the
ability
to
imagine
her
own
future

she
was
urged
by
a
friend
to
enter
aÂ stand-upÂ competition

But
in
2015

as
Australia
debated
the
legality

When
Kate
Swensonâ€™s
son
Cooper
was
diagnosed
with
severe

nonverbal
autism

her
world
stopped

She
had
always
dreamed
of
having

She
hadnâ€™t
signed
up
for
life
as
a
mother
raising
a
child
with
a
disability

At
first

experienced
the
grief
of
broken
dreams

Then
she
felt
the
frustration
and
exhaustion
of
having
to
fight
for
your
child
in
a
world
that
is
stacked
against
them

But
through
hard
work

resilience
and
personal
growth

she
would
come
to
learn
that
Cooper
wasnâ€™t
the
one
who
needed
to
change

She
was

And
it
was
this
transformation
that
led
Kate
to
acceptanceâ€”and
ultimately
joy

what

The
Subtle
Art
of
Not
Giving
a
F*ck

A
Counterintuitive
Approach
to
Living
a
Good
Life
Mark
Manson
#1
New
York
Times
Bestseller
Over
10
million
copies
sold
In
this
generation-defining
self-help
guide

a
superstar
blogger
cuts
through
the
crap
to
show
us
how
to
stop
trying
to
be
"positive"
all
the
time
so
that
we
can
truly
become
better

happier
people

For
decades

weâ€™ve
been
told
that
positive
thinking
is
the
key
to
a
happy

rich
life

"F**k
positivity
"
Mark
Manson
says

"Letâ€™s
be
honest

shit
is
f**ked
and
we
have
to
live
with
it
"
In
his
wildly
popular
Internet
blog

Manson
doesnâ€™t
sugarcoat
or
equivocate

He
tells
it
like
it
isâ€”a
dose
of
raw

refreshing

honest
truth
that
is
sorely
lacking
today

The
Subtle
Art
of
Not
Giving
a
F**k
is
his
antidote
to
the
coddling

letâ€™s-all-feel-good
mindset
that
has
infected
American
society
and
spoiled
a
generation

rewarding
them
with
gold
medals
just
for
showing
up

Manson
makes
the
argument

backed
both
by
academic
research
and
well-timed
poop
jokes

that
improving
our
lives
hinges
not
on
our
ability
to
turn
lemons
into
lemonade

but
on
learning
to
stomach
lemons
better

Human
beings
are
flawed
and
limitedâ€”"not
everybody
can
be
extraordinary

there
are
winners
and
losers
in
society

and
some
of
it
is
not
fair
or
your
fault
"
Manson
advises
us
to
get
to
know
our
limitations
and
accept
them

Once
we
embrace
our
fears

faults

and
uncertainties

once
we
stop
running
and
avoiding
and
start
confronting
painful
truths

we
can
begin
to
find
the
courage

perseverance

honesty

responsibility

curiosity

and
forgiveness
we
seek

There
are
only
so
many
things
we
can
give
a
f**k
about
so
we
need
to
figure
out
which
ones
really
matter

Manson
makes
clear

While
money
is
nice

caring
about
what
you
do
with
your
life
is
better

because
true
wealth
is
about
experience

A
much-needed
grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye
moment
of
real-talk

filled
with
entertaining
stories
and
profane

ruthless
humor

The
Subtle
Art
of
Not
Giving
a
F**k
is
a
refreshing
slap
for
a
generation

The
Art
of
War
Sun
Tzu
The
Art
of
War
is
a
translation
of
Sun
Tzuâ€™s
originally
written
book
on
battle
strategies
by
author
James
Clavell

Sun
Tzu
believed
war
to
be
an
essential
wrongdoing
that
must
be
got
rid
of
whenever
it
can
be

The
war
should
be
fought
fleetingly
to
reduce
economic
decline

Sun
Tzu
harped
on
the
significance
of
placement
in
military
tactics

The
planning
to
position
an
army
must
be
dependent
on
the
stipulations
in
the
physical
surroundings
and
the
subjective
thoughts
of
various
militants
in
those
conditions

He
believed
that
strategy
cannot
be
considered
as
planning
with
respect
to
glancing
through
a
previously
decided
list

It
is
better
represented
by
the
fact
that
it
needs
speedy
and
suitable
reactions
to
altering
situations

Planning
gives
results
in
restrained
surroundings

But
in
case
of
an
altering
environment

similar
plans
come
in
each
otherâ€™s
ways
and
give
rise
to
undesired
outcomes

The
book
has
been
a
profound
factor
in
the
workings
of
Eastern
and
Western
military
strategies

business
planning

legal
thought
processes

The
David
and
Goliath
story
of
ordinary
people
in
El
Salvador
who
rallied
together
with
international
allies
to
prevent
a
global
mining
corporation
from
poisoning
the
countryâ€™s
main
water
source
At
a
time
when
countless
communities
are
resisting
powerful
corporationsâ€”from
Flint

Michigan

to
the
Standing

to
Didipio
in
the
Philippines

to
the

tells
the
inspirational
story
of
a
community
that
took
on
an
international
mining
corporation
at
seemingly
insurmountable
odds
and
won
not
one
but
two
historic
victories

In
the
early
2000s

many
people
in
El
Salvador
were
at
first
excited
by
the
prospect
of
jobs

progress

and
prosperity
that
the
Pacific
Rim
mining
company
promised

However

farmer
Vidalina
Morales

brothers
Marcelo
and
Miguel
Rivera

and
others
soon
discovered
that
the
river
system
supplying
water
to
the
majority
of
Salvadorans
was
in
danger
of
catastrophic
contamination

With
a
group
of
unlikely
allies

local
and
global

they
committed
to
stop
the
corporation
and
the
destruction
of
their
home

Based
on
over
a
decade
of
research
and
their
own
role
as
international
allies
of
the
community
groups
in
El
Salvador

Robin
Broad
and
John
Cavanagh

this
untold
storyâ€”a

replete
with
corporate
greed

a

lawsuit
at
a
secretive
World
Bank
tribunal
in
Washington

violent

The

immerses
the
reader
in
the
lives
of
the
Salvadoran
villagers

the

about
the

Sugarloaf
Ranch
not

changed
since
legendary
gunfighter
Smoke
Jensen
and
his
wife
Sally
tamed
the

two
decades

Raising
cattle
is
still
a
dangerous
businessâ€”and
just
as
deadly
as
ever

When
Smoke
is
injured
swapping

some
cow
thieves

Sally

The

as
theyâ€™re
called

have
all
disgraced
themselves
in
some
way

there

Maybe
they
botched
an
Op
so
badly
they
canâ€™t
be

anymore

Maybe
they
got
in
the

Maybe
they
just

on
the

unusual
in
this
line
of

One
thing
they
have
in

is
they

the

With

Sir
Phillip
knew
that
Eloise

a
spinster

and
so
heâ€™d

to
marry

Except






she
wasnâ€™t

And
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
kiss
her






As
for
Eloise

she
couldnâ€™t

a
man
she

never

she
found
herself

this
imperfect
man
be
perfect
for

the
truth
behind
his
abandonmentâ€”only
to
end
up
in
the
sights
of
a
ruthless
killer

After
months
away

Wilde
has
returned
to
the
Ramapo
Mountains
in
the
wake
of
a
failed
bid
at
domesticity
that
confirms
what
heâ€™s
known
all
along

He
belongs
on
his
own

free
from
the
comforts
and
constraints
of
modern
life

Suddenly

a
DNA
match
on
an
online
ancestry
database
brings
Wilde
closer
to
his
past
than
heâ€™s
ever
dreamed

and
finally
gives
Wilde
the
opening
he
needs
to
track
down
his
father

But
meeting
the
man
brings
up
more
questions
than
answers

So
Wilde
reaches
out
to
his
last

most
desperate
lead

a
second
cousin
who
disappears
as
quickly
as
he
resurfaces

having
experienced
an
epic
fall
from
grace
that
can
only
be
described
as
a
waking
nightmare

Was
his
cousinâ€™s
downfall
a
long
time
coming?
Or
was
he
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
as
cunning
as
it
is
complex?
And
how
does
it
all
connect
to
the
man
once
known
as
The
Stranger

a
treacherous
fugitive
with
a
growing
following
whose
mission
and
methods
have
only
turned
more
dangerous
with

Thereâ€™s

Working

LAPD

RenÃ©e

waits
out
the
traditional
rain

into

Only

Ballard

a
scene
where
a
hardworking

fatally

by
a
bullet
in
the
middle
of

Â 
Ballard
quickly
concludes
that
the
deadly
bullet
could
not
have
fallen
from

and
that
it

in

indelibly

It
is
a
department
so
hampered

inertia

that
Ballard
must
go
outside

shortly

a

murdered
in

The

is
believed
to
be
made
up
of
vigilante
killers
who
are
very
boredâ€¦and
very
rich

They
target
the
worst
of
societyâ€”rapists

murderers

and
thievesâ€”and
then
use
their
unlimited
resources

carefully
choreographed

and
with
no
apparent
direct
connection
to
the

the

are
virtually
untraceable

These
days

it
can
feel
like
information
is
coming
at
us
from
every
direction

Itâ€™s
probably
happened
to
you
before

You
caught
a
few
minutes
of
a
news
broadcast

came
across
a
viral
meme
or
photo
on
social
media

got
a
push
alert
or
a
family
member
messaged
you
in
a
group
chat
â€”
and
you
may
not
feel
like
you
got
the
whole
story

The
widespread
availability
of
information
â€“
from
all
different
kinds
of
sources
â€“
is
great
for
learning
new
facts
and
perspectives
from
around
the
world

But
it
can
also
make
it
difficult
to
sort
out
what
information
is
credible
and
what
isnâ€™t

Earlier
this
week

Sundar
announced
Google
is
investing
$10
million
to
help
fight
misinformation
about
the
realities
and
facts
of
the
war
in
Ukraine

This
includes
new
partnerships
with
think
tanks
and
civil
society
organizations
to
conduct
region-specific
research
into
misinformation
and
disinformation
and
cash
grants
to
support
fact-checking
networks
and
nonprofits

International
Fact-Checking
Day
on
April
2
is
a
good
reminder
of
the
essential
value
of
fact
checking
in
this
complicated
information
landscape

To
do
this
efficiently

itâ€™s
helpful
to
have
easy-to-use
tools
to
check
sources

get
valuable
context

and
evaluate
information

Here
are
four
ways
you
can
use
Google
to
help

Tips
for
evaluating
information

right
on
Search
Sometimes
when
news
is
breaking
or
a
new
topic
is
trending

the
information
you're
searching
for
isn't
broadly
available
yet

In
these
moments

Search
automatically
shows
a
notice
on
your
search
results
indicating
that
it
can
take
time
for
a
range
of
sources
to
publish
information
on
a
topic

These
notices
are
currently
available
in
more
than
20
languages
around
the
world

Starting
today

on
searches
in
English
in
the
U
S


these
notices
will
also
include
tips
to
help
you
evaluate
information
online
â€“
reminding
you
that
you
can
check
whether
a
source
is
trusted
on
a
topic

or
come
back
later
when
thereâ€™s
more
information
available

You
can
also
check
out
our
new
resource
page
with
pointers
to
help
you
navigate
the
information
youâ€™re
finding
online

based
on
research
from
information
literacy
experts

Here

you
can
find
helpful
reminders
for
when
you
come
across
new
information

like
searching
about
the
author
of
a
piece
of
content
to
get
a
sense
of
their
credibility

or
checking
the
publication
date
to
make
sure
itâ€™s
still
relevant

An
example
of
new
information
literacy
tips
on
notices
for
rapidly
evolving
situations

A
new
label
for
highly
cited
sources
Letâ€™s
say
a
local
news
organization
breaks
an
investigative
story
looking
into
problems
at
your
local
school
district

The
story
is
so
big
that
it
gets
picked
up
by
numerous
other
media
outlets

But
what
if
you
didnâ€™t
see
that
original
story

which
had
unique
context
for
local
residents?
Weâ€™re
introducing
a
way
to
help
you
identify
stories
that
have
been
frequently
cited
by
other
news
organizations

giving
you
a
simple
way
to
find
the
most
helpful
or
relevant
information
for
a
news
story

This
label
will
appear
on
Top
Stories

You
will
be
able
to
find
it
on
anything
from
an
investigative
article

to
an
interview

an
announcement

a
press
release
or
a
local
news
story

as
long
as
other
publishers
indicate
its
relevance
by
linking
to
it

Weâ€™re
particularly
interested
in
the
potential
to
elevate
original
reporting

making
it
even
easier
for
people
to
discover
and
engage
with
the
publishers
and
journalists
whose
work
brings
unique
value
to
a
story

The
highly
cited
label
is
launching
soon
on
mobile
in
English
for
the
U
S

and
will
roll
out
globally
in
the
coming
weeks

Fact
checks
from
independent
fact-checking
organizations
Fact

features
on

are
another
way
to
easily
find
information
that
has
been
verified
by
independent
fact-checking
organizations

When
you
search
for
a
topic
that
may
be
disputed

you
might
see
fact-check
articles
in
your
results

These
results
display
snippets
to
help
you
get
context
about
a
claim
that
was
made

Additionally

when
you
browse
Google

on

you
can
see
recently

Message
from
the
Vice-President

Research
and
Innovation
Dear
Colleagues

As
you
may
know

the
Council
of
Ontario
Universities
announced
on
March
11

2022
that

â€œIn
order
to
minimize
uncertainty
and
disruption
and
to
continue
to
support
our
students

staff

faculty
and
university
communities

Ontarioâ€™s
universities
will
maintain
their
COVID-19
vaccination
and
masking
policies
until
at
least
the
end
of
the
current
term
â€? 
The
University
of
Windsor
announced
on
March
17
that
it
would
retain
institutional
COVID-19
policies

despite
the
Provinceâ€™s
removal
of
mask
mandates
on
March
21
and
intention
to
lift
all
remaining
COVID-19
restrictions
by
the
end
of
April

After
consultations
with
the
Chair
of
the
Research
Safety
Committee

Chair
of
the
Research
Ethics
Board

Environmental
Health


Safety
Manager

Chair
of
the
Return
to
Campus
Action
Group

and
colleagues

I
am
pleased
to
announce
a
pause
to
all
University
of
Windsor
requirements
for
research
protocol
/
laboratory
operation
approvals

effective
March
28

2022
 
This
pause
also
applies
to
approvals
for
field
work
and
research
involving
human
participants

All
faculty

staff

and
students
must
still
adhere
to
University
of
Windsor
health
and
safety
policies
related
to
COVID-19
until
Phase
4
Normal
status
is
established

However

after
March
28

there
will
no
longer
be
independent
vetting
of
safety
protocols
related
to
research
conducted
on
and
off
campus

Effective
March
28

all
research
activities
will
be
governed
by
the
Universityâ€™s
health
and
safety
regulations
and

for
field
work

any
additional
health
and
safety
regulations
of
the
host
site
 
Until
the
University
removes
or
suspends
its
mask
policy

breaching
of
physical
distancing
in
research
involving
human
participants
will
be
permissible
with
appropriate
personal
protective
equipment
and
vaccination
(though
caution
is
urged)

I
sincerely
hope
that
this
pausing
of
research
approvals
will
turn
out
to
be
permanent

and
that
no
new
variant
of
concern
will
emerge
and
necessitate
the
reintroduction
of
restrictions

All
the
best

Dear
Colleagues

I
am
sure
you
have
been
monitoring
the
COVID-19
infection
data

and
like
me
you
are
thankful
that
the
impact
of
the
Omicron
variant
is
abating
in
the
Province
(https
//covid19-sciencetable

)
as
well
as
in
Windsor-Essex
(https

)
 
The
Premier
Officeâ€™s
news
release
on
January
20

2022
announced
three
stages
of
lifting
of
restrictions
with
the
first
stage
on
January
31
 
The
next
stage
was
set
on
February
21

As
you
have
no
doubt
heard

the
Premier
announced
earlier
today
that
Ontario
will
be
able
to
enter
into
this
next
stage
ahead
of
schedule
and
on
February
17
 
After
consultation
with
colleagues

including
Chairs
of
the
Research
Safety
Committee
and
the
Research
Ethics
Board

I
would
be
pleased
to
lift
the
restrictions
placed
on
research
and
innovation
announced
on
January
5
on
February
17

in
concert
with
the
Provinceâ€™s
moving
forward
to
this
next
stage
 
This
means
that
if
your
Faculty
was
at
Research
Phase
3
prior
to
January
5

it
will
revert
back
to
Research
Phase
3
 
If
your
approved
normal
research
protocol
permits
breach
of
physical
distancing

you
will
once
again
be
able
to
conduct
such
research
as
authorized

After
almost
two
years
of
the
pandemic

vaccination

masking

and
physical
distancing
have
remained
the
most
effective
means
against
COVID
infection
 
I
know
we
are
all
tired

but
I
remain
optimistic
that
a
semblance
of
normalcy
is
just
around
the
corner

and
that
we
will
emerge
from
the
pandemic
wiser
if
not
stronger

All
the
best

Dear
Colleagues

I
trust
you
had
a
good
holiday
break
and
were
able
to
enjoy
some
much
deserved
rest
and
recreation

Please
note
the
following
updates
to
research
protocols
during
Modified
Step
2
of
the
Roadmap
to
Reopen
announced
by
the
Government
of
Ontario
effective
January
5

2022

Implement
as
much
as
possible
a
voluntary
reduction
of
your
research
personnel
working
in
a
laboratory
setting
at
any
given
time
by
50%
from
the
capacity
on
December
16

2021
to
reduce
contact
between
persons
due
to
the
high
infectiousness
of
the
Omicron
variant

Be
vigilant
about
masking

wearing
eye
protection

maintaining
physical
distancing
of
at
least
2
metres
at
all
times

avoiding
gathering
around
the
laboratory
to
minimize
the
risk
of
transmission

and
washing
hands
frequently

Stop
research
with
human
participants
that
requires
the
breaching
of
physical
distancing
limits
 
Breaching
occurs
when
interactions
with
human
participants
exceed
a
total
of
15
minutes
within
a
given
day
when
physical
distancing
of
at
least
2
metres
cannot
be
maintained

Prepare
a
contingency
plan
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
possible
extended
absences
of
key
research
personnel
due
to
quarantining

Plan
for
the
potential
consequences
of
reduced
staffing
at
the
Chemical
Control
Centre
and

Central
Animal
Care
Facility

The
Research
Safety
Committee
will
continue
to
re-evaluate
field
work
that
was
approved
in
2021
but
has
yet
to
take
place

in
accordance
with
updated

from
the

Research
and
Innovation
Dear
Colleagues

As
you
are
aware

as
long
as
COVID-19
infection
rate
continues
to
stay
low

the
University
is
planning
to
implement
increased
capacity
in
teaching
and
research
labs
in
the
Winter
Term

up
to
the
maximum
fire-code
capacity

or
50
students

whichever
is
less
 
After
consultation
with
colleagues
at
Health
and
Safety
and
the
Research
Safety
Committee
(RSC)

I
am
writing
to
provide
information
on
implementing
/
continuing
to
implement
the
following
interim
measures
with
regards
to
research
lab
operations
between
October
25

2021
and
January
6

2022
 
Further
communication
regarding
increasing
research
lab
capacity
in
the
Winter
Term
will
be
forthcoming
 
Health
and
Safety
will
be
determining
fire-code
capacities
of
individual
labs
and
ensuring
that
they
are
posted
prior
to
beginning
of
the
Winter
term

Interim
measures

Halt
the
need
for
revision
of
currently
approved
protocol
that
involves
personnel
additions/removals

however

the
PI
should
keep
track
of
personnel
changes
 
RSC
will
stop
tracking
of
personnel
tied
to
safety
protocols
and
will
no
longer
update
the
master
spreadsheet
database

Halt
the
need
for
revision
of
protocol
that
specifies
specific
rooms
and
buildings
accessed
by
personnel
 
Posted
laboratory
capacity
limits
that
observe
2-metre
distancing
will
still
need
to
be
observed

Require
PI
to
have
an
approved
safety
protocol

Require
RSC
to
vet
and
approve
protocols
from
PIs
who
do
not
have
a
currently
approved
protocol

Require
RSC
to
vet
all
protocols
involving
field
research
and
breaches
of
physical
distancing
of
2
metres

and
Require
new
visiting
researchers/students
from
other
institutions
to
follow
UWindsorâ€™s
visiting

Dear
Colleagues

I
trust
you
have
heard
that
the
Province
of
Ontario
is
moving
on
July
16
to
Step
Three
of
the
Roadmap
to
Reopen

five
days
ahead
of
schedule
 
This
is
wonderful
news
and
one
that
we
all
rejoice
in

after
16
long
months
of
COVID-19
restrictions
 
The
projections
are
certainly
encouraging
for
the
fall
term

and
I
look
forward
to
the
days
that
we
can
meet
physically
and
enjoy
one
anotherâ€™s
company
again

With
reopening
of
the
Province

the
University
of
Windsor
is
loosening
restrictions

and
I
am
writing
to
highlight
those
that
are
research

from
the
Vice-President

Research
and
Innovation
Colleagues

As
you
have
no
doubt
heard

the
Ontario
government
plans
to
re-open
the
province
in
three
steps

based
on
vaccination
thresholds
 
Step
1
will
be
initiated
when
60%
of
adults
are
vaccinated

estimated
to
be
the
week
of
June
14

2021

In
synchronization
with
Step
1

the
University
of
Windsor
will
lift
restrictions
introduced
on
April
8
with
regards
to
research
protocols
and
applications
 
The
Research
Safety
Committee
(RSC)

Research
Ethics
Board
(REB)

and
Animal
Care
Committee
(ACC)
will
resume
approval
of
new
research
protocols
and
applications
 
This
change
will
be
implemented
automatically
on
the
first
day
that
Ontario
enters
Step
1

no
further
communication
will
be
required

 We
thank
you
for
your
patience
during
the
shut-down
period
and
look
forward
to
continuing
working
with
you
in
support
of
your
research
endeavours
as
authorized
in
your
faculty
research
phase

Our
ability
to
maintain
research
on
campus
is
heavily
reliant
on
everyoneâ€™s
vigilance
when
it
comes
to
health
and
safety
in
keeping
COVID-19
at
bay

their
approval
with
you
prior
to
travelling
to
campus
and
accessing
common
and
research
spaces
 
Everyone
should
strictly
adhere
to
masking
and
physical
distancing
protocols
 
Vaccination
has
proven
to
be
effective
in
decreasing
COVID-19
transmission

morbidity
and
mortality

and
we
urge
you
to
get
vaccinated
as
soon
as
you
are
able
to

On
campus
saliva-based
testing
and
wastewater-based
epidemiology
of
COVID-19
continue
to
progress
with
the
goal
of
providing
as
much
information
on
the
status
of
infection
at
the
University
as
possible
 
The
saliva-based
testing
will
be
expanding
its
research
cohort
in
the
summer
with
the
aim
to
making
it
available
to
everyone
in
the
fall
term

please
consider
participating
when
testing
is
open
to
you

Let
me
end
by
thanking
and
recognizing
every
one
of
you
for
your
ongoing
commitment
to
research
 
We
can
all
be
proactive
in
order
to
facilitate
reopening
of

Message
from
the
Vice-President

Research
and
Innovation
Colleagues

As
you
have
no
doubt
heard

the
Province
has
imposed
a
stay-at-home
order
effective
Thursday

April
8

2021
 
I
am
writing
to
urge
everyone
of
you
to
continue
to
be
vigilant
and
not
let
your
guard
down
so
that
we
can
ensure
that
our
campus
can
stay
safe
and
open
for
research
and
innovation

Please
allow
me
to
start
by
reminding
you
of
what
I
have
said
in
earlier
communications

I
would
also
emphasize
important
health
and
safety
points
that
are
paramount
to
our
mitigating
the
threats
of
COVID-19

and
especially
the
variants
of
concern
(VOC)

to
our
campus

Unless
you
must
be
on
campus
to
carry
out
your
research

please
stay
away

Please
observe
the
no
close
contact
rules
established
by
public
health
authorities
and
keep
track
of
colleagues
who
are
in
the
same
areas
or
labs
as
you
are

This
is
critical
in
the
event
that
contact-tracing
is
required

Be
as
vigilant
outside
of
the
campus
as
you
are
within
it
to
help
ensure
that
we
keep
the
virus
away
from
the
campus
and
our
research
community
safe
 
This
includes
respecting
the
stay-at-home
order
and
avoiding
as
much
as
possible
travel
outside
of
the
Windsor-Essex
Region

Observe
provincial
COVID-19
rules
and
regulations
at
all
times

Observe
all
health
and
safety
guidelines
and
procedures
established
by
the
University
and
public
health
authorities

observe
maximum
capacities
and
health
and
safety
plans
for
common
and
research
spaces

and
adhere
to
protocols
approved
for
your
project
and/or
lab
by
the
Research
Safety
Committee
(RSC)

If
it
is
available
to

COVID
testing
led
by
Dr

Lisa
Porter

as
I
said
in
my
April
2
communication

Dr

Porter
and
her
colleagues
are
expanding
their
research
cohort
to
include
those
outside
of
CORe

but
this
will
take
time

contact
Jackie
Fong
for
details
if
you
are
interested
 
Negative
results
will
inform
the
University
that
you
are
unlikely
to
have
been
infected
should
an
outbreak
occur
in
the
vicinity
of
your
lab
 
This
will
help
your
team
to
quickly
return
to
normal

In
parallel

Dr

Mike
McKay
and
his
colleagues
will
expand
the
wastewater
surveillance
program
to
provide
monitoring
beyond
Alumni
Hall

again
this
will
take
time
 
If
you
have
questions

contact
Dr

McKay

The
University
will
be
working
closely
with
the
Windsor-Essex
County
Health
Unit
(WECHU)
upon
any
COVID-19
cases

Your
understanding

vigilance
and
cooperation
will
help
ensure
that
the
University
can
remain
open
for
research
and
innovation

All
currently
authorized
research
projects/lab
operations

including
those
that
involve
face-to-face
research
(in
person
data
collection)
with
human
participants

can
proceed
as
authorized

however

principal
investigators
are
requested
to
voluntarily
reduce
personnel
at
any
given
time
in
their
labs

and
also
their
hours

where
workable

The
Central
Animal
Care
Facility
(CACF)
will
continue
to
operate
with
a
maximum
occupancy
of
15

Central

operate

where
workable

while
minimizing
contact
and
the
number
of
individuals
in
these
facilities

Please
note
that
RSC
is
not
approving
any
new
research
protocols
(unless
these
are
COVID-19-related)
or
the
addition
of
new
research
personnel
(except
for
COVID-19
research)
 
Replacing
personnel
and
amendment
of
protocols

however

can
still
proceed
so
long
as
replacements
do
not
involve
any
training
of
new
research
personnel
 
The
RSC

REB
and
Animal
Care
Committee
(ACC)
will
continue
to
review
protocols
that
have
been
submitted
as
well
as
new
protocols
and
applications
so
as
not
to
create
any
potential
review
logjams
down
the
road
 
However

no
new
protocols
will
be
authorized
by
the
RSC
or
ACC
to
start
during
the
state
of
emergency
or
shutdown

The
REB
will
continue
to
review
and
clear
new
applications
that
have
been
submitted
that
do
not
involve
in-person
data
collection
requiring
breach
of
physical
distancing

Again

please
be
reminded
that
during
the
provincial
shutdown

other
units
within
the
University
and
outside
organizations
may
operate
at
a
reduced
capacity

This
may
impact
upon
the
supply
of
reagents
and
consumables

as
well
as
the
cleaning
of
common
areas

Extra
planning
and
precautions
should
be
exercised

It
is
also
important
to
remember
and
share
with
your
students
and
staff
that
they
must
complete
the
Safe
Lancer
App
Survey
or
online
Self-Assessment
questionnaire
and
file
their
approval
with
you
prior
to
travelling
to
campus
and
accessing
common
and
research
spaces

As
a
supervisor

you
will
be
responsible
for
maintaining
a
record
of
these
filings
that
can
be
accessed
readily

Although
we
hope
it
will
not
be
necessary

access
to
this
information
may
be
critical
in
potential
contact-tracing
in
the
future

Let
me
end
by
thanking
and
recognizing
every
one
of
you
for
your
ongoing
commitment
to
research
 
Our
ability
to
keep
research
and
innovation
going
will
rely
heavily
on
your
vigilance
and
our
ability
to
keep
COVID-19
at
bay
 
Vaccination
and
on-campus
testing
are
two
powerful
tools
that
we
can
employ
 
I
urge
that
you
vaccinate
as
soon
as
it
is
made
available
to
you
and
participate
in
the
on-campus
saliva-based
testing
if
it
is
available
to
you
 
We
can
all
be
proactive
in
order
to
make
a
difference

Keep
well
and
safe

the

Dear
Colleagues

As
you
may
already
be
aware

the
rate
of
COVID-19
infection
in
Windsor-Essex
has
declined
significantly
over
the
past
few
weeks

Today

the
Province
announced
that

with

however

the
cautionary
note
that
any
spike
in
infection
cases
could
either
delay
the
reopening
or
force
it
to
return
to
lockdown

With
the
above
proviso

I
am
delighted
to
announce
herein
that
all

that
have
been
operating
in
â€œModified

Code
Grey
(Lockdown)
and
the
restrictions
associated
with

including
those
provided
by
the
Chemical

with
their
supervisor
prior
to

Supervisors
should
continue
to
maintain
an
accurate
and
up-to-date
record
of
approval
filings
as
we
move
forward

I
would
like

once
again

to
thank
all
of
you
for
your
continued
commitment
to

been
for
all
of
you

I
am
very
hopeful
that
we
will
see
a
return
to
more
normal
times
in
the
not-too-distant

for
Code
Grey

the
Office
of
the
Vice-President

and
the
manager
of
Health
and
Safety
on
the
steps
that
are
necessary
regarding
research
during
Code
Grey

All
research
that
can
be
performed
away
from
the
campus
(e
g


writing
of
manuscripts

theses
and
proposals

performing
statistical
and
data
analyses

modelling

meetings

conducting
interviews
and
surveys

etc
)
should
be
conducted
off-campus

irrespective
of
research-phase
designations
of
your
Faculty

All
in-person

face-to-face
research
with
human
participation
(as
research
subjects)
will
be
suspended

Faculties
currently
in
Research
Phase
3
will
enter
â€œModified
Research
Phase
3â€?

others
will
remain
at
their
current
research
phases

Lab
operations
will
proceed
initially
as
authorized

but
PIs
are
requested
to
be
vigilant
and
voluntarily
reduce
the
personnel
at
any
given
time
in
their
labs

where
workable

Upon
requirement
by
the
Windsor-Essex
County
Health
Unit
(WECHU)
or
in
response
to
outbreak
on
campus

and
especially
in
the
labs

the
number
of
personnel
in
the
lab
will
be
reduced
by
X%
(20%
or
larger

to
be
determined
depending
on
situation)

RSC
will
work
with
Faculty
deans
and/or
PIs
to
achieve
the
X%
reduction
(input

building
access
logs

occupancy
data

etc
)
The
Central
Animal
Care
Facility
(CACF)
will
operate
under
Modified
Research
Phase
3
with
a
maximum
occupancy
of
10

Central
research
facilities
under
Modified
Research
Phase
3
will
have
their
managers
/
technologists
develop
work
plans
to
minimize
contact

e
g


Reversion
to
a
service-based
model
where
access
is
limited
to
technical
staff

Scheduling
different
days
for
activities
by
different
groups
or

and
Work
plans
will
need
to
be
submitted
to
RSC
for
approval

Grey

other
units
within
the
University
and
outside
organizations
may
operate
at
a
reduced
capacity

This
may
impact
upon
the
supply
of
reagents
and
consumables

as
well
as
the
cleaning
of
common
areas
and
snow
removal

Extra
planning
and
precautions
should
be
exercised

It
is
also
important
to
remember
and
share
with
your
students
and
staff
that
they
must
complete
the
Safe
Lancer
App
Survey
and

their
approval
with
you
prior
to
travelling
to
campus
and
accessing
common
and
research
spaces

As
a
supervisor

you
will
be
responsible
for
maintaining
a
record
of
these
filings
that
can
be
accessed
readily

Although
we
hope
it
will
not
be
necessary

access
to
this
information
may
be
critical
in
potential
contact
tracing
in
the
future

I
would
like
to
thank
and
recognize
every
one
of
you
for
your
ongoing
commitment
to
research
and
the
effort
you
have
put
into
continuing
research
during
these
unprecedented
times

The
pandemic
has
proven
to
be
extremely
challenging

We
are
now
at
a
critical
juncture
in
combatting
COVID-19
and

with
availability
of
vaccines
albeit
limited
initially

there
seems
to
finally
be

Message
from
the
Vice-President

Research
and
Innovation
Dear
Colleagues

I
hope
that
this
message
finds
you
well

On
November
13

2020

the
province
of
Ontario
released
an
update
to
its
COVID-19
Response
Framework

Keeping
Ontario
Safe
and
Open

The
framework
divides
Ontarioâ€™s
COVID-19
restriction
levels
into
five
colour-coded
categories

Green
(Prevent)

Yellow
(Protect)

Orange
(Restrict)

Red
(Control)

and
Grey
(Lockdown)

As
you
are
likely
already
aware

the
rate
of
COVID-19
infection
in
Windsor-Essex
has
increased
significantly
over
the
past
weeks

leading
the
province
to
move
our
region
to
the
Orange
(Restrict)
category
effective
November
20

2020

Unless
this
trend
is
arrested

Windsor-Essex
is
on
track
for
escalated
restriction
to
category
Red
(Control)
in
the
near
future

I
am
writing
to
you
today
to
urge
continued
vigilance
in
adherence
to
guidance
developed
by
the
University
and
public
health
authorities
to
prevent
the
spread
of
COVID-19

and
to
discuss
possible
strategies
that
the
University
may
deploy
to
support
the
continuation
of
research
in
the
event
of
further
provincial
restrictions
in
our
region

In

Critical
Research
Committee

comprising
representatives
from
Faculties

departments

and
offices
across
our

developed
a
comprehensive
framework
and
process
for
the
resumption
of
research
activities
at
the
University
of
Windsor

Restrictions

The
UWindsor
Framework
for
the
Resumption
of
Research
provides
a
strong

yet
flexible

framework
that
will
allow
our
research
activities
to
resume
in
a
phased
and
coordinated
manner

With
an
overarching
principle
of
protecting
the
health
and
safety
of
our
campus
research
community
and
the
communities
with
which
we
conduct
research

this
framework
and
corresponding
processes
have
been
designed
to
function
in
concert
with
Ontarioâ€™s
roadmap
for
the
reopening
of
the
province
and
to
reflect
guidance
provided
by
the
Province
and
the
Chief
Medical
Officer
on
strategies
for
continued
public
and
workplace
health
and
safety

The
UWindsor
Framework
for
the
Resumption
of
Research
comprises
the
following
phases

and
allows
for
smooth
and
rapid
transition

2020
On
June
1

2020

the
University
of
Windsor
implemented
the
UWindsor
Framework
for
the
Resumption
of
Research
to
facilitate
the
orderly
and
phased-in
reopening
of
research
facilities
and
on-site
access
under
the
evolving
conditions
associated
with
the
COVID-19
pandemic

The
UWindsor
Framework
for
the
Resumption
of
Research
provides
a
process
that
allows
for
researchers
to
apply
to
resume
critical
research
activities
as
the
University
transitions
away
from
the
current
essential
service-only
model

The
framework
defines
â€œcriticalâ€?
research
as
research
that
has
been
assessed
and
determined
to
be
critical
by
the
Department
Head
and
Dean

evaluated
by
the
Research
Safety
Committee

approved
by
the
Dean

and
formally
authorized
by
the
Vice-President

Research
and
Innovation

Department
Heads
and
Deans
use
the
Critical
Research
Assessment
Tool
to
evaluate
the
criticality
of
research
based
on
urgency
and
time-sensitiveness

impact
of
research
on
collaborators

funding
agency
timelines
and
deliverables

impact
on
physical
and
economic
health
of
the
community

and
the
contribution
of
the
research
to
student
training

These
factors
are
balanced
against
additional
risks
related
to
implementing
the
proposed
research

including
the
number
of
personnel
required
to
meet
project
needs

their
ability
to
maintain
physical
distancing
given
resource
constraints
of
laboratory
space
or
field
work
activities

availability
of
requested
space
and
resources
given
on-going
activities
of
approved
research

the
need
for
internal
and
external
essential
services
required
for
delivery
of
consumables
and
supplies

maintenance
and

of
equipment

and
emergency
response

Department
Head
and
Dean

Categories
of
critical
research
may
include

Research
related
to
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19
that
cannot
be
undertaken
remotely

Research
in
which
delay
and
resumption
will
have
direct
impacts
on
the
ability
of
the
community
to
provide
essential
services

including
health
services

to
the
public

Long-running
research/field
research
in
which
a
serious
loss
of
research
material

data

or
equipment
could
occur
if
the
work
is
disrupted

is
at
a
critical
stage

or
close
to
an
end
point

Research
required
to
meet
a
contract
deadline
with
an
industrial
or
government
partner
that
cannot
be
renegotiated

where
failure
to
complete
the
research
would
irrevocably
harm
the
relationship
with
that
partner

and/or
Research
that

if
paused

would
negatively
impact
the
ability
of
a
graduate
student
to
complete
program
requirements
within
the
next
three
months
and
requires
minimal
on-site
work
time
to
complete

If
you
feel
that
your
research
project
meets
the
aforementioned
criteria
and
would
like
to
apply
to
have
your
research
project
designated
as
critical
so
that
you
can

A
Phased
Resumption
of
UWindsor
Research
and
Innovation
-
May

2020
Dear
Members
of
the
UWindsor
Research
Community

By
now
many
of
you
will
have
watched
or
read
Ontario
Premier
Doug
Fordâ€™s
announcement
on
May
14

2020
unveiling
A
Framework
for
Reopening
our
Province
â€“
Stage
1

The
Provinceâ€™s
plan
provides
a
roadmap
for
the
first
stage
of
its
phased
approach
to
reopening
businesses

services

and
public
spaces
across
the
province

while
maintaining
the
health
and
safety
strategies
established
to
protect
Ontarians
and
mitigate
the
spread
of
COVID-19

The
What
Stage
1
Means
for
Industry
Service
and
Retail
section
of
the
plan
indicates
that
the
province
will
begin
easing
restrictions
on
a
variety
of
industry
services
and
retail
activities

including
â€œopening
non-essential
professional
services
related
to
conducting
research
and
experimental
development
in
physical

engineering
and
life
sciences

such
as
biotechnology

agriculture
and
industrial
research
and
development
labsâ€?

I
know
many
of
you
have
questions
about
what
this
means
for
the
resumption
of
research
activities
at
UWindsor

and
I
am
writing
to
provide
you
with
an
update

The
University
is
finalizing
a
framework
that
will
allow
our
research
activities
to
resume
in
a
phased
and
coordinated
manner

This
framework
will
be
in
sync
with
the
roadmap
provided
by
the
provincial
government
and
will
reflect
guidance
provided
by
the
Province
and
the
Chief
Medical
Officer
of
Health
on
strategies
for
continued
public
and
workplace
health
and
safety

Despite
the
fact
that
the
Province
has
included
research
in
Stage
1
of
its
plan
for
reopening

the
University
of
Windsor
continues
to
operate
on
an
essential
services-only
model

It
must
be
emphasized
that
all
research
activities
must
conform
with
established
guidelines
for
physical
distancing

enhanced
hygiene
and
cleaning

monitoring
of
sick
workers

use
of
personal
protective
equipment

and
limited
gatherings

We
must
also
consider
the
availability
of
supplies
and
access
to
services

including
emergency
response

I
hope
to
share
UWindsorâ€™s
framework
for
the
resumption
of
research
with
you
in
the
near
future

I
thank
faculty
and
administration
colleagues
who
have
been
working
with
me
on
developing
this
framework

Until
the
University
has
communicated
otherwise

only
research
that
can
be
conducted
virtually

does
not
require
the
research
to
be
on
campus

and
does
not
require
any
travel
by
the
research
team
or
the
research
participants
can
continue
unabatedly
 
I
laud
the
efforts
of
all
of
you
in
upholding
research
output

including
analyzing
data

planning
for
and
writing
books

preparing
articles

manuscripts
and
theses

conducting
online
supervision

investigations
and
interviews

and
writing
research
proposals
during
this
challenging
time

All
research
that
requires
on-campus
access

face-to-face
interaction

or
travel
to
another
site
continues
to
be
suspended
unless
it
has
been
deemed
essential
in
nature
and
has
been
preapproved
by
the
Faculty
Dean
and
authorized
by
the
Vice-President

Research
and
Innovation

Animal
Care
All
researchers
using
animals
in
their
work
are
herein
advised
that
the
University
of
Windsor
Central
Animal
Care
Facility
and
other
Aquatic
Research
Facilities
will
implemented
the
Pandemic
Plan
effective
March
26

2020

Researchers
with
questions
or
concerns
regarding
the
Plan
or
the
use
of
research
animals
during
this
time
are
asked
to
contact
the
Chair
of
the
Animal
Care
Committee
(ACC)

John
Hudson

or
the
Operations
Manager
of
the
Central
Animal
Care
Facilities
(CACF)

Linda

(see

The
current
situation
with
the
COVID-19
outbreak
is
unprecedented

We
would
like
to
ensure
you
that
your
research
animals
are
being
cared
for
and
that
the
safety
of
animal
care
staff

researchers

and
students
is
prioritized
 
Social-distancing
is
of
prime
importance
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
 
Furthermore

as
we
do
not
have
a
timeline
as
to
when
the
situation
will
improve

we
are
trying
to
maximize
our
resources
so
that
we
can
provide
acceptable
animal
husbandry
for
as
long
as
possible

With
the
implementation
of
the
Pandemic
Plan

the
following
guidelines
will
come
into
effect
March
26

2020

Access
to
all
Animal
Care
Facilities

including
those
in
CACF

the
Great
Lakes
Institute
for
Environmental
Research
(GLIER)

and
the
Freshwater
Restoration
Ecology
Centre
(FREC)

will
be
restricted
to
animal-care
staff
and
approved
research
staff
only
(see
below)

This
step
is
being
taken
to
reduce
the
possibility
that
staff
are
accidently
exposed
to
carriers
of
COVID-19

as
well
as
other
transmittable
diseases
 
We
want
to
ensure
as
much
as
possible
that
we
have
healthy
trained
staff
available
to
care
for
your
research
animals

and
that
we
take
all
the
steps
necessary
to
mitigate
the
potential
of
complete
closure
and
the
resulting
culling
of
research
animals

Please
be
advised
that
we
were
in
the
process
of
hiring
additional
staff

This
process
has
been
expedited
and
we
have
a
new
aquatic
animal
care
technician
starting
Monday

March
30

2020

We
have
also
increased
the
hours
of
our
part-time
animal
care
staff

Given
that
we
are
moving
to
an
essential
staff
model
of
care

all
additional
care
fees
over
and
above
annual
fees
incurred
during
this
period
will
be
waived
 
Approved
research
staff
will
be
limited
to
one
person
per
specific
research
group
once
per
week
with
the
approval
of
the
Chair
of
ACC
and
the
Operations
Manager
of
CACF

This
will
also
apply
to
Aquatic
Research
Facilities
until
the
aquatic
animal
care
technician
is
in
place
and
has
been
trained
 
CACF
staff
will
care
for
the
animals
in
all
other
groups
 
If
you
have
questions
or
concerns
regarding
this

please
contact
the
Chair
of
ACC
or
the
Operations
Manager
of
CACF

No
new
animals
will
be
ordered
into
the
facilities

This
includes
animals
from
commercial
suppliers

as
well
as
animals
imported
from
other
academic
institutions

Field
studies
involving
capture
and
long-term
holding
of
animals
in
research
facilities
must
also
be
suspended

 
Male
and
female
animals
will
be
moved
to
separate
cages
to
curtail
breeding
 
This
separation
is
best
performed
by
research
staff
so
that
they
can
ensure
accurate
identification
of
individuals
and
updating
of
breeding
records
 
An
exception
will
be
granted
with
respect
to
CACF
access
for
this
purpose
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
Chair
of
ACC
or
the
Operations
Manager
of
CACF
 
If
research
staff
are
unable
to
separate
their
animals
in
a
timely
fashion

animal
care
staff
will
do
so

Please
note

we
realize
that
some
researchers
have
essential
animal
lines
that
must
be
maintained

If
this
is
the
case

please
coordinate
with
the
Operations
Manager
of
CACF

Linda
Sterling

on
how
to
proceed
with
the
care
of
these
research
animals

All
experimental
procedures
involving
research
animals
will
be
prohibited
until
the
COVID-19
crisis
has
abated

This
includes
recovery
surgical
procedures

administration
of
substances
likely
to
cause
pain

and
distress
or
illness

The
exception
to
this
would
be
in
the
case
of
long-term
studies
in
which
animals
are
aging

no
manipulation
is
required

or
animals
are
being
bred
to
maintain
a
critical
colony

 
Researchers
are
being
consulted
to
determine
the
relative
value
and
priorities
of
individual
animals
and
strains

Irreplaceable
animals/strains
will
be
assigned
higher
priority
than
other
animals

Our
hope
is
that
the
situation
will
not
come
to
this
but
we
must
plan
for
the
event
that
we
do
not
have
sufficient
staff
or
supplies
to
provide
adequate
care

(see
7)
 
Some
standard
operating
procedures
may
be
amended
as
required
at
the
discretion
of
the
Operation
Manager
of
CACF
(or
designate)
 
For
example

cage
changing
schedules
may
be
altered
if
animal
care
staff
numbers
are
significantly
reduced

 
If
it
becomes
impossible
to
maintain
all
animals
in
the
facility
during
the
pandemic

the
Operations
Manager
of
CACF
(or
designate)
may
require
the
humane
euthanasia
of
animals
beginning
with
those
of
lowest
priority

 We
hope
this
will
not
become
necessary

however

please
inform
the
CACF
your
priorities
at
your
earliest
convenience

Research
Ethics
As
the
context
for
the
COVID-19
situation
is
changing
rapidly

the
REB
has
updated
its
guidelines
for
all
research
involving
human
participants

The
important
criterion
that
needs
to
be
borne
in
mind
is
physical
distancing

All
research
which
is
conducted
on-line

does
not
require
the
research
to
be
on
campus

and
does
not
require
any
travel
by
the
research
team
or
the
research
participants
may
continue

Research
which
requires
travel
to
campus
or
another
site
(even
if
only
one
person
is
travelling)
must
be
suspended
unless
it
meets
the
following
criteria

a
 It
is
considered
â€œEssentialâ€?
as
determined
through
consultation
involving
researchers
and
Departmental
Heads
or
Institute
Directors

and
where
appropriate

Deans

approved
by
the
Dean

and
authorized
by
the
Vice-President

Research
and
Innovation
(VPRI)
(see
Continuation
of
Research
during
the
COVID-19
Pandemic
above)

and
b
 If
Essential
research
requires
travel

satisfactory
plans
regarding
travelling

field
activities

participants

dates
and
schedules

emergency
plans

g


regarding
sickness)
and
where
appreciate

approval
by
the
hosting
authority
and/or
community

must
be
provided
in
writing
to
the
Dean
and
updated
regularly

All
research
requiring
in-person
interaction
must
be
suspended

The
REB
advises
revising
in-person
data
collection
methods
to
on-line
through
phone
or
on-line
platforms

if
possible

taking
into
consideration
that
these
methods
do
not
increase
risks
to
participants

The
REB
is
reviewing
research
related
to
COVID-19
as
rapidly
as
possible

Personnel
The
Office
of
the
Vice-President

Research
and

(OVPRI)
is
continuing
the
appointment
of
grant-funded
research
personnel
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic

However

we
ask
that
supervisors
carefully
consider
and
use
the
upmost
discretion
when
appointing
new
and/or
reappointing
existing
research
personnel
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic

and
wherever
possible
and
appropriate

supervisors
are
asked
to
holdoff
on
appointing
new
and/or
reappointing
existing
research
personnel
until
the
pandemic
has
subsided
and
physical
distancing
measures
have
been
lifted

In
the
event
that
supervisors
need
to
move
forward
with
appointing
new
and/or
reappointing
existing
research
personnel

they
should
ensure
that
the
appointee
can
work
remotely

contributing
to
research
that
is
conducted
online

and
does
not
require

The
COVID-19
challenge
is
dynamic
and
the
plans
for
research
and
innovation
may
need
to
be
revised
as
the
challenge
changes
 
The
Universityâ€™s
Pandemic
Planning
Committee
and
the
Executive
Leadership
Group
are
meeting
regularly
to
monitor
the
situation
 
The
University
will
continue
to
follow
the
leads
of
both
the
federal
and
the
provincial
public
health
agencies

Car
Talk
uses
Discourse
as
a
forum
for
their
thousands
of
loyal
listeners
and
readers

We
dare
you
to
come
up
with
a
question
about
cars
that
can
not
be
answered
on
their
forum
of
experts


avid
hobbyists

Discourse
is
flat
out
amazing

Itâ€™s
powerful

reliable

and
flexible

We
transitioned
from
another
provider
a
year
ago
and
never
looked
back

Weâ€™ve
only
just
started
to
tap
into
its
versatility

Andâ€”
oh

the
best
part?
They're
great
folks
who
are
smart
and
listen

our
needs

Frostbite
is
a
game
engine
originally
developed
by
EA
DICE
for
its
Battlefield
series

Frostbite
uses
Discourse
as
a
private
forum
to
discuss
company-specific
internal
technologies
and
toolsets

Traditionally

most
of
our
communication
has
been
done
via
mailing
lists

but
as
our
community
has
grown
over
the
past
few
years
the
mailing
list
model
has
increasingly
become
a
hurdle
for
us
for
many
types
of
communication

for
a
variety
of
reasons

This
topic
on
Meta
gives
a
nice
overview
of
why
a
particular
sub-community
inside
Frostbite
really
prefers
Discourse
over
mailing
lists

Western
Digital
uses
Discourse
as
a
public
support
forum
for
their
product
line

(


)
The
more
we
get
to
know
the
Discourse
platform

the
more
we
fall
in
love
with
it

Itâ€™s
simple
and
intuitive

but
much
more
powerful
than
you
imagine

We
donâ€™t
know
how
many
times
we
got
lost
cruising
around
checking
out
all
the
features

And

as
a
plus

we
really
enjoy
working
with
the
Discourse
team

CCP
Games
uses
Discourse
for
EVE
Online

There

EVE
gamers
can
follow
announcements

suggest
features

report
technical
issues
and
discuss
game
balance

GitHub
enforces
a
written
security
information
program

Our

aligns
with
industry

includes
security
safeguards
reasonably
designed
to
protect
the
confidentiality

integrity

availability

resilience
of
our
Users'

is
appropriate
to
the
nature

size

and
complexity
of
GitHubâ€™s
business
operations

includes
incident
response
and
data
breach
notification
processes

and
complies
with
applicable
information
security-related
laws
and
regulations
in
the
geographic
regions
where
GitHub
does
business

In
the
event
of
a
data
breach
that
affects
your
User
Personal
Information

we
will
act
promptly
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
a
breach
and
notify
any
affected
Users
without
undue
delay

thatâ€™s

For

if
you
contact
our
Support
team
with
a

we
respond
to
you
via

You
have
a

of
control
over
how
your

associates
many

We
are
not

If

would
like
your

to
remain

even
when

commenting
on
public

you
can
create
a

You
should
also
update
your
local
Git
configuration
to
use
your
private
email
address

This
will
not
change
how
we

it
will
affect

Londonâ€™s
most

who

And

Society
Papers

April
1814
But
this
time
the
gossip
columnists
have
it
wrong

Anthony
Bridgerton
hasnâ€™t
just
decided
to
marryâ€”heâ€™s
even
chosen
a
wife!
The
only
obstacle
is
his
intendedâ€™s
older
sister

Kate
Sheffieldâ€”the
most
meddlesome
woman
ever
to
grace
a
London
ballroom

The
spirited
schemer
is
driving
Anthony
mad
with
her
determination
to
stop
the
betrothal

but
when
he
closes
his
eyes
at
night

Kateâ€™s
the
woman
haunting
his
increasingly
erotic
dreams




Contrary
to
popular
belief

Kate
is
quite
sure
that
reformed
rakes
do
not
make
the
best
husbandsâ€”and
Anthony

is
the

wicked
rogue
of

all

Kateâ€™s
determined
to
protect
her
sisterâ€”but
she
fears
her
own
heart
is
vulnerable

And
when
Anthonyâ€™s
lips
touch
hers

sheâ€™s
suddenly
afraid
she
might
not

To
Sir
Phillip

with
Love
Julia
Quinn
Sir
Phillip
knew
that
Eloise
Bridgerton
was
a
spinster

and
so
he'd
proposed

figuring
that
she'd
be
homely
and
unassuming

and
more
than
a
little
desperate
for
an
offer
of
marriage

Except






she
wasn't

The
beautiful
woman
on
his
doorstep
was
anything
but
quiet

and
when
she
stopped
talking
long
enough
to
close
her
mouth

all
he
wanted
to
do
was
kiss
her






and
more

Did
he
think
she
was
mad?
Eloise
Bridgerton
couldn't
marry
a
man
she
had
never
met!
But
then
she
started
thinking






and
wondering






and
before
she
knew
it

she
was
in
a
hired
carriage
in
the
middle
of
the
night

on
her
way
to
meet
the
man
she
hoped
might
be
her
perfect
match

Except






he
wasn't

Her
perfect
husband
wouldn't
be
so
moody
and
ill-mannered

and
while
Phillip
was
certainly
handsome

he
was
a
large
brute
of
a
man

rough
and
rugged

and
totally
unlike
the
London
gentlemen
vying
for
her
hand

But
when
he
smiled






and
when
he
kissed
her






the
rest
of
the
world
simply
fell
away

and
she
couldn't
help
but
wonder






could
this
imperfect
man
be
perfect
for
her?

As

Sheâ€™s

of
all

But
Gabrielaâ€™s

has
a

But
when
they

Centering
on
the
infamous
World
War
II
firebombing
of
Dresden

the
novel
is
the
result
of
what
Kurt
Vonnegut
described

a
twenty-three-year
struggle

An
instant
bestseller

Slaughterhouse-Five
made
Kurt
Vonnegut
a
cult
hero
in
American
literature

a
reputation
that
only
strengthened
over
time

despite
his
being
banned
and
censored
by
some
libraries
and
schools
for
content
and
language

But
it
was
precisely
those
elements
of
Vonnegutâ€™s
writingâ€”the
political
edginess

the
genre-bending
inventiveness

the
frank
violence

the
transgressive
witâ€”that
have
inspired
generations
of
readers
not
just
to
look
differently
at
the
world
around
them
but
to
find
the
confidence
to
say
something
about
it

Vonnegutâ€™s
words

Jonathan
Safran
Foer
has
described
Vonnegut
as
â€œthe
kind
of
writer
who
made
peopleâ€”young
people
especiallyâ€”want
to
write
â€?
George
Saunders
has
declared
Vonnegut
to
be
â€œthe
great

urgent

passionate
American
writer
of
our
century

a

Fifty
years
after
its
initial
publication
at
the
height
of
the
Vietnam
War

Vonnegut's
portrayal
of
political
disillusionment

PTSD

and
postwar
anxiety
feels
as
relevant

darkly
humorous

and
profoundly
affecting

enduring
beacon

Multi-award-winning
Hannah
Gadsby
broke
comedy
with
her
show
Nanette
when
she
declared
that
she
was
quitting
stand-up

Now
she
takes
us
through
the
defining
moments
in
her
life
that
led
to
the
creation

Nanette

â€œHannah

â€œThere
is
nothing
stronger
than
a
broken
woman
who
has
rebuilt
herself
â€?Â Hannah
Gadsby
declared
in
her
show
Nanette

a
scorching
critique
of
the
way
society
conducts
public
debates
about
marginalized
communities

When
it
premiered
on
Netflix

it
left
audiences
captivated
by
her
blistering
honesty
and
her
singular
ability
to
take
them
from
rolling
laughter
to
devastated
silence

Ten
Steps
to
Nanette
continues
Gadsbyâ€™s
tradition
of
confounding
expectations
and
norms

properly
introducing
us
to
one
of
the
most
explosive

formative
voices
of
our
time

Gadsby
grew
upÂ as
the
youngest
of
five
childrenÂ in
an
isolated
town
in
Tasmania

whereÂ homosexuality
was
illegal
until
1997

She
perceived
her
childhood
as
safe
and
â€œnormal
â€?
but
as
she
gained
an
awareness
of
her
burgeoning
queerness

the
outside
world
began
to
undermine
the
â€œvulnerably
thin
veneerâ€?
of
her
existence

After
moving
to
mainland
Australia
and
receiving
aÂ degreeÂ in
art
history

Gadsby
found
herself
adrift

working
itinerant
jobs
and
enduring
years
of
isolation
punctuated
by
homophobic
and
sexual
violence

At
age
twenty-seven

without
a
home
or
the
ability
to
imagine
her
own
future

she
was
urged
by
a
friend
to
enter
aÂ stand-upÂ competition

She
won

and
so
began
her
career
in
comedy
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Gadsby
became
well
known
for
her
self-deprecating

autobiographical
humor
that
made
her
the
butt
of
her
own
jokes

But
in
2015

as
Australia
debated
the
legality
of
same-sex
marriage

Gadsby
started
to
question
this
mode
of
storytelling

beginning
work
on
a
show
that
would
become

relationship
with

Â andÂ her

Even

Bestselling
novelist
Sara
Medlar
is
skilled
at
sharing
stories
about
other
people

but
she
hoped
the
truth
about
her
own
family
would
never
surface

Her
home
in
Lachlan

Florida

is
her
refuge
and
she
loves
having
her
niece
Kate
and
dear
friend
Jack
Wyatt
together
under
her
roof

The
Medlar
Three

as
they
are
known
around
town

have
sworn
off
getting
involved
in
any
more
murder
investigations

When
the
sheriff
unexpectedly
leaves
on
vacation

Jack
is
surprised
to
find
himself
appointed
as
deputy

So
when
Kate
stumbles
upon
a
dead
body
while
visiting
a

the
Medlar
Three
are

Kate
also
has
a
charming
new
real
estate
client
with
a
mysterious
past

He
seems
to
be
followed
by
trouble
and
that
makes
Sara
and
Jack
uneasy

It
doesnâ€™t
take
long
to
discover
that
the
murder
and
the
new
man
in
town
are
somehow
relatedâ€”the
question
is
how

When
the
strangerâ€™s
true
identity
is
revealed

Sara
realizes
her
carefully
crafted
story
is
about
to
unravel
and
she
fears
sheâ€™ll
lose
Kate
and
Jack
forever

But
she
desperately
hopes
that
love
and
honesty
will
win
out
over
years
of
lies
and
deceit

And
besides

is

if
you
sometimes
want
to
kill
them

Vol

Two
feudal
kingdoms

Midland
and
Chuder

battle
for
supremacy
in
what
will
become
the
final
clash
in
a
century-long
struggle

Spearheading
the
Midland
forces
is
the
Band
of
the
Hawk

a
legendary
cadre
of
elite
mercenaries
led
by
the
charismatic
Griffith
and
with
the
fearless
Guts
as
its
berserker
champion

The
Hawks'
ferocity

courage

and
fearsome
skills
-
not
to
mention
Guts'
enormous
broadsword
-
are
just
what
Midland
needs
to
turn
the
bloody
tide

but
during
the
fray

Guts
and
Griffith's
most
trusted
lieutenant

Casca

fall
together
from
a
cliff
into
a
raging
river

Miraculously

both
barely
survive

and
Guts
tends
to
Casca's
wounds
as
she
tells
of
having
her
life
saved
by
Griffith

her
induction
into
the
Band
of
the
Hawk

and
her
deep
feelings
toward
Griffith

She
even
seems
to
finally
be
warming
up
to
the
grim
Guts

But
this
greeting-card
moment
won't
last
long

for
Chuder
warriors
are
on
the
prowl

and
the
only
greetings
they
carry
are
on
the
points
of
their
spears!

Now
that

the

But
itâ€™s
a
deadly
reunion

one
that
nearly
takes
Gutsâ€™
life

The
following
years
see
Guts
wandering
from

to
battlefield

where
his
awesome
skills
as
a

catch
the

the

is
eager

those
of
the

usual

anytime

defeating

shatters

Gutsâ€™
lover

Casca

And
while
time
may
heal
some
of
Gutsâ€™
wounds

it
will
not
heal
his
desire
for
vengeance

And
his
discovery
of
a
gigantic

be
just

Staying
in
residence
was
also
helpful
with
the
transition
to
Canada

I
was
able
to
connect
with
other
students
and
get
familiar
with
the
campus

I
even
worked
for

services

This
enhanced
my
communication
skills
and
allowed
me
to
gain
some
valuable
work
experience

have
taken
advantage

the
services
available
at
the

Success
Centre
by
booking
monthly
appointments
with

These

allowed

to

Having

improved

My
University
of

experience

exceptional

The
teaching
is
incredible

amazing

and
superior
support
from
faculty
members

Whether
for

I
believe
that
the
University
of
Windsor
prepared
me
for
entering
the
workforce
and
I
credit
the
renowned
co-op
program
for
giving
me
the
skills
and
experience
to
succeed
in
a
post-graduate
world

My
advice
to
incoming
international
students
is
to
make
meaningful
connections
(both
personal
and
professional)
whether
it
be
through
co-op
or
joining
clubs
on
campus

and
take
advantage
of
all
the
resources
the
University
has
to
offer
as
they
will
set
you
up
for
success

the

I
came
to
the
University
of
Windsor
to
obtain
my
Master
of
Engineering
degree

I
gained
the
necessary
industry
skills
and
knowledge
from
the
courses
that
helped
me
excel
in
my
current
field
of
work

The
resources
that
helped
me
succeed
in
my
university
career
are
the
International
Student
Centre
(ISC)
and
Career
Development
Services
(CDEL)

as
they
assisted
with
work
permits

Visa's
and
strengthening
my
resume
and
cover
letter

My
advice
to
incoming
international
students
is
to
gain
as
much
work
experience
in
Canada
as
possible
and
to
utilize
UWindsor's
on-campus
resources
to
succeed

When
I
was
deciding
where
to
study
in
Canada
it
was
clear
that
studying
at
the
University
of
Windsor
would
be
one
of
the
best
decisions
I
would
ever
make

I
learned
so
much
and
grew
in
many
ways
and
I
look
forward
to
giving
back
to
my
community

I
participated
in
the
Ignite
Work
Study
program
where
I
worked
at
the
International
Student
Centre

This
gave
me
insight
into
a
lot
of
resources
available
at
the
University

I
also
used
the
career
advising
resources
at
the
Odette
School
of
Business

where
I
was
given
the
tools
to
succeed
in
the
Canadian
workplace

My
advice
is
to
ensure
your
resume
and
cover
letter
are
well
written
and
meet
the
Canadian
standard
and
gain
Canadian
work-related
experience
by
volunteering
in
any
capacity

What
Is
Personal
Data
at
Apple?
At
Apple

we
believe
strongly
in
fundamental
privacy
rights
â€”
and
that
those
fundamental
rights
should
not
differ
depending
on
where
you
live
in
the
world

Thatâ€™s
why
we
treat
any
data
that
relates
to
an
identified
or
identifiable
individual
or
that
is
linked
or
linkable
to
them
by
Apple
as
â€œpersonal
data
â€?
no
matter
where
the
individual
lives

This
means
that
data
that
directly
identifies
you
â€”
such
as
your
name
â€”
is
personal
data

and
also
data
that
does
not
directly
identify
you

but
that
can
reasonably
be
used
to
identify
you
â€”
such
as
the
serial
number
of
your
device
â€”
is
personal
data
 Aggregated
data
is
considered
nonâ€‘personal
data
for
the
purposes
of
this
Privacy
Policy

This
Privacy
Policy
covers
how
Apple
or
an
Apple-affiliated
company
(collectively

â€œAppleâ€?)
handles
personal
data
whether
you
interact
with
us
on
our
websites

through
Apple
apps
(such
as
Apple
Music
or
Wallet)

or
in
person
(including
by
phone
or
when
visiting
our
retail
stores)

Apple
may
also
link
to
third
parties
on
our
services
or
make
third-party
apps
available
for
download
in
our
App
Store

Appleâ€™s
Privacy
Policy
does
not
apply
to
how
third
parties
define
personal
data
or
how
they
use
it

We
encourage
you
to
read
their
privacy
policies
and
know
your
privacy
rights
before
interacting
with
them
 
Your
Privacy
Rights
at
Apple
At
Apple

we
respect
your
ability
to
know

access

correct

transfer

restrict
the
processing
of

and
delete
your
personal
data

We
have
provided
these
rights
to
our
global
customer
base
and
if
you
choose
to
exercise
these
privacy
rights

you
have
the
right
not
to
be
treated
in
a
discriminatory
way
nor
to
receive
a
lesser
degree
of
service
from
Apple

Apple
does
not
sell
your
data
including
as
â€œsaleâ€?
is
defined
in
Nevada
and
California
 
To
exercise
your
privacy
rights
and
choices
including
where
a
third-party
service
provider
is
acting
on
Appleâ€™s

To
help
protect
the
security
of
your
personal
data

you
must
sign
in
to
your
account
and
your
identity
will
be
verified

If
the
Data

Privacy
page
is
not
available
in
your
region

you
can
make
privacy
rights
requests
at
apple
com/legal/privacy/contact
 
There
may
be
situations
where
we
cannot
grant
your
request
â€”
for
example

if
you
ask
us
to
delete
your
transaction
data
and
Apple
is
legally
obligated
to
keep
a
record
of
that
transaction
to
comply
with
law

We
may
also
decline
to
grant
a
request
where
doing
so
would
undermine
our
legitimate
use
of
data
for
anti-fraud
and
security
purposes

such
as
when
you
request
deletion
of
an
account
that
is
being
investigated
for
security
concerns

Other
reasons
your
privacy
request
may
be
denied
are
if
it
jeopardizes
the
privacy
of
others

is
frivolous
or
vexatious

or
would
be
extremely
impractical

If
you
live
in
California

if
you
cannot
access
Appleâ€™s
Data
and
Privacy
page

you

can
make
a
request
at

Apple
understands
the

13
or
the
equivalent
age
as
specified
by
law
in
your
jurisdiction

That
is
why
Apple

protections
to
help
keep
children's
personal
data
safe

To
access

Children

which
describes
how
Apple
handles
children's
personal

parental
consent
 
Educational
Institutions

Educational

Josh

who
is
currently
pursuing
his
computer
science
degree
at
Kingâ€™s
College
in
London

proves
you
don’t
need
decades
of
programming
experience
to
make
an
impact

When
heâ€™s
not
hacking
away
at
school

Josh
dedicates
his
time
to
helping
others
learn
to
code
â€”
mainly
through
his
involvement
in
the
KCL
Tech
Society
and
as
a
student
advocate
at
HackCampus

which
connects
students
to
internship
opportunities
at
startups
in
the
UK

We
talked
to
Josh
about
these
two
initiatives
and
learned
more
about
his
other
passion

hackathons

and
how
they
bring
the
tech
community
together

Erin

Give
us
the
basics

Who
is
Josh
Simpson
and
what
does
he
do?
Josh

At
the
moment
Iâ€™m
a
4th-year
computer
science
student
in
London

For
the
past
year
and
a
half

Iâ€™ve
been
doing
a
lot
of
work
with
the
hackathon
community
here

I
also
work
with
Hack
Campus

which
helps
connect
developers
with
companies
and
provides
a
better
intern
experience

Erin

How
long
have
you
been
developing
software?
Josh

Iâ€™d
love
to
say
it
has
been
for
the
entire
time
Iâ€™ve
been
doing
my
degree

but
thatâ€™s
not
really
true

Iâ€™ve
really
been
investing
in
learning
to
code
for
about
the
past
two
years

Erin

There
are
so
many
new
avenues
for
learning
to
code

do
you
have
thoughts
about
the
advantages
of
going
through
a
traditional
program?
Josh

The
biggest
advantage
at
the
moment
is
that
I
have
four
years
of
working
within
safety
nets

As
a
student

you
have
so
much
to
protect
you
from
what
could
go
wrong
in
the
real
world

If
something
did
go
horrifically
wrong

Iâ€™ve
got
a
backup
system
somewhere

Someone
has
the
job
to
help
me
and
make
sure
I
donâ€™t
fail
massively

which
is
a
huge
advantage
to
going
the
traditional
route

But
itâ€™s
definitely
no
longer
mandatory

You
donâ€™t
have
to
get
a
computer
science
degree
to
go
into
programming

I
think
itâ€™s
fantastic

the
amount
of
people
who
are
self-taught
whoâ€™ve
come
out
just
as
good
if
not
so
much
better
than
a
lot
of
the
programmers
who
learn
at
university

Itâ€™s
inspiring

People
who
have
just
sat
there
at
home
and
thought

â€˜Iâ€™m
going
to
do
thisâ€™

while
working
part-time
or
full-time
jobs

They
come
home
and
spend
a
few
hours
in
the
evening
every
day
for
a
few
weeks

and
theyâ€™ve
actually
picked
up
something
which
Iâ€™ve
studied
for
four
years
to
get
the
same
level

So
yeah

itâ€™s
impressive

Erin

Were
there
people
who
you
looked
up
to
when
you
were
getting
into
programming?
Josh

Yeah

definitely

There
are
some
really
fantastic
people
around
the
hackathon
community

They
are
so
focused
on
just
teaching
others

I
really
admire
Joe
Nash

who
is
the
developer
evangelist
for
Improbable

When
I
met
him

he
was
doing
a
lot
of
work
with
MLH

and
he
brought
me
along
to
my
first
hackathon

It
was
through
him
that
I
actually
started
getting
involved
in
the
hackathon
community

He
helps
me
out
with
job
interviews
and
tells
me
how
I
can
better
myself

Heâ€™s
one
of
those
people
who
will
tell
you
what
youâ€™re
doing
is
wrong

incessantly

but
you
argue
with
him
for
five
minutes
and
then
you
go

â€œyouâ€™re
right

youâ€™re
actually
completely
right
about
this
â€?
Which
is

I
think

an
incredible
ability

Erin

What
sparked
in
your
mind
that
development
was
something
you
wanted
to
do

Josh

Four
years
ago
I
enrolled
myself
in
a
computer
science
course
thinking
that
it
was
a
lot
lighter
â€”
I
had
no
idea
it
was
programming

essentially

I
stuck
with
it
for
a
couple
of
years

but
I
was
doing
my
degree
for
the
sake
of
doing
my
degree
â€”
I
wasnâ€™t
doing
anything
on
the
side

I
wasnâ€™t
helping
myself

At
the
beginning
of
my
third
year

I
realized
I
needed
to
find
other
like-minded
people
and
engage
with
them

I
found
the
KCL
Tech
Society
and
joined
up
with
them

started
going
to
workshops

figuring
out
how
people
teach

figuring
out
how
they
host
all
of
these
fantastic
community
events

Over
the
year

I
got
more
and
more
involved

to
the
point
where
suddenly
I
was
running
workshops
on
Ruby
on
Rails

I
taught
a
room
full
of
people
to
go
from
zero
to
web
application
in
two
hours!
That
was
the
big
moment
where
I
thought

â€˜hey

Iâ€™m
pretty
good
at
being
a
developer
â€™
I
started
building
school
projects
and
putting
together
hackathons

I
built
Dot
to
Dot
with
a
friend
at
Hack
the
Planet

It
teaches
people
how
to
use
APIs
and
how
to
build
their
own

That
involved
54
hours
of
no
sleep
before
we
actually
started
the
hack

so
the
naming
was
a
little
bit
off

It
was
a
nice
feeling
that
everyone
seemed
to
actually
enjoy
using
it

Erin

Why
should
more
people
get
involved
with
hackathons?
Josh

Thereâ€™s
a
massive
culture
around
learning

building

and
sharing

People
who
have
never
coded
before
in
their
life
can
go
to
a
hackathon
and
learn
how
to
build
a
web
application
in
24
hours

And
on
the
flip
side
of
that

you
have
a
community
that
is
so
invested
in
taking
the
time
to
teach
other
people
â€”
itâ€™s
24
hours
in
a
room
filled
with
people
who
share
the
same
interest
of
building
stuff
and
teaching
each
other

There
are
very
few
places
in
the
world
and
very
few
fields
where
you
can
find
that
same
thing

Erin
People
say
â€˜get
involved
with
the
communityâ€™
but
it
can
be
really
hard
to
put
yourself
out
there

especially
if
youâ€™re
shy
or
donâ€™t
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
your
code

Any
advice
for
getting
past
that?
Josh

Itâ€™sâ€¦really
difficult

One
of
the
pieces
of
advice
we
give
people
who
donâ€™t
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
their
code
is
to
point
to
other
people
in
the
room

including
myself
â€”
and
this
is
the
nice
thing
about
hackathons
â€”
where
we
can
say
that
we
have
no
specific
expertise

no
singular
experience
that
makes
us
better
than
anybody

We
have
an
interesting
idea

and
one
of
us
managed
to
draw
together
enough
code
to
make
it
work

and
this
is
the
same
stuff
we
do
in
our
workshops

Itâ€™s
the
same
as
if
you
went
through
code
academy
â€”
itâ€™s
just
framed
differently

Itâ€™s
difficult
to
get
involved
until
you
realize
that
youâ€™re
just
as
good
as
everyone
else
was
at
some
point

Some
people
have
just
had
the
experience
to
go
â€˜oh

I
actually
know
how
to
apply
this
in
this
one
specific
wayâ€™

Erin

And
one
might
say
that
you
could
get
that
experience
to
apply
your
ideas
by
going
to
hackathons?
Josh

Yeah

haha

I
would
encourage
people
to
just
find
a
meetup
locally

Find
a
bunch
of
people
who
are
interested
in
something
similar

itâ€™s
really
helpful
and
theyâ€™ll
teach
you
a
bunch
of
stuff
that
you
didnâ€™t
know
beforehand

which
lets
you
come
back
and
say
â€˜I
know
this
little
bitâ€™

and
the
cycle
continues
from
there

A
new
person
will
come
to
the
meetup
and
itâ€™s
your
turn
to
say

â€˜hey

did
you
know
this
beforehand?â€™
Erin

Iâ€™d
love
to
talk
about
Hack
Campus
â€”
Whatâ€™s
so
cool
about
it?
Josh

We
approach
startups
and
advocate
for
students
by
encouraging
them
to
hire
interns

The
startups
pay
a
studentâ€™s
wages
for
ten
weeks
–
itâ€™s
Â£350
which
is
pretty
good
–
and
we
sort
out
their
accommodations
right
in
the
heart
of
London

So
it
takes
away
the
issue
of
having
to
find
and
pay
for
a
place
to
stay

removing
a
lot
of
stress
out
of
that
situation

And
because
youâ€™re
working
at
a
startup
that
canâ€™t
just
throw
money
away
on
them

interns
are
working
on
production
code
or
getting
their
hands
on
something
important
fairly
quickly

Erin
Can
you
tell
me
about
some
of
the
results
of
the
program?
Josh

Sure

Itâ€™s
growing
very
slowly
â€”
last
summer
was
actually
the
first
time
weâ€™ve
run
the
program

We
have
a
bunch
of
testimonials
from
the
people
who
were
involved
last
year

They
mainly
said
it
was
a
badass
experience

We
had
people
who
said
it
was
so
valuable
they
would
have
done
it
for
free
â€”
that
they
were
pushing
code
by
day
20

And
thatâ€™s
really
cool

that
students
â€”
students
â€”
are
saying

yeah

I
wouldâ€™ve
done
that
for
free

We
need
to
get
better
and
more
diverse
backing
to
scale
the
program

The
way
itâ€™s
run
now
is
as
a
single
arm
of
Index
Ventures

but
the
idea
would
be
to
scale
that
up
so
we
can
go
to
more
places

and
new
startups

and
bring
in
more
students

This
model
doesnâ€™t
seem
to
exist
in
America

but
Iâ€™d
love
to
see
something
like
this
take
hold
there
in
the
future

The
University
of
Windsor
will
name
its
new
sports
and
recreation
complex
the
Toldo
Lancer
Centre

officials
announced
Tuesday
outside
the
complexâ€™s
main
doors

The
centre
is
being
named
after
the
late
entrepreneur
and
philanthropist
Anthony
P

Toldo

who
supported
many
local
causes

focusing
primarily
on
health
services

To
continue
his
legacy
of
philanthropy

he
established
the
Toldo
Foundation
in
1996

After
Toldo
died
in
2009

his
son
Anthony
G

(Tony)
Toldo
took
the
helm
of
the
foundation

â€œMaking
an
impact
in
the
areas
of
health
and
wellness
has
been
a
priority
for
our
family
for
generations
â€?
said
Tony
Toldo

â€œWe
are
confident
the
Toldo
Lancer
Centre
will
be
a
central
hub
for
fitness
and
recreation
activities
for
the
campus
and
Windsor-Essex
communities
â€?
This
is
the
latest
contribution
of
the
Toldo
Foundation
to
the
University
of
Windsor

The
foundationâ€™s
support
helped
realize
the
construction
of
the
Anthony
P

Toldo
Health
Education
and
Learning
Centre

home
to
the
Faculty
of
Nursing

The
Toldo
Foundation
funds
scholarships

ground-breaking
research

and
learning
spaces
at
the
University

enhancing
experiences
and
expanding
opportunities
for
students

staff

and
faculty

The
Toldo
Lancer
Centre
is
a
â€‹state-of-the-art

accessible
facility
featuring
a
triple
gymnasium
with
seating
for
2
000
spectators

an
eight-lane

25-metre
pool

a
recreational
walking
and
running
track

a
fitness
centre

and
multi-purpose
rooms

Open
to
all

this
community
hub
will
help
improve
the
health
of
residents
in
the
region

Set
to
open
this
fall

the
$73
million
complex
will
be
able
to
host
international

national

and
provincial
games
and
championships
as
well
as
large-scale
events

conferences

and
more

â€œThe
Toldo
Lancer
Centre
is
a
bold
and
ambitious
project
with
immense
potential
benefits
for
our
campus
communities
and
for
Windsor-Essex

We
are
thrilled
to
be
working
in
partnership
to
create
this
important
focal
point

which
will
bring
communities
together
and
to
enhance
health
and
wellness
across
the
region
â€?
said
UWindsor
president
Robert
Gordon

â€œWe
believe
this
project
will
truly
build
our
campus

build
community

and
build
champions
â€?
He
noted
the
University
has
a

Today

weâ€™re
adding
a
proxy
on
top
of
the
GitHub
Advisory
Database
that
speaks
the
`npm

protocol

This

that

Avoiding
npm
substitution
attacks
Supply
chain
attacks
are
a
reality
in
modern
software
development

Thankfully

you
can
reduce
the
attack
surface
by
taking
precautions
and
being
thoughtful
about
how
you
manage
your
dependencies

We
hope
you
walk
away
from
this
with
tangible
steps
to
take
to
ensure
youâ€™re
protecting
yourself
when
using
npm

This
post
is
focused
on

Inclusion
Together

racism

discrimination

and
oppression
form
one
of
the
great
challenges
of
our
time

The
University
of
Windsor
is
addressing
it

The
university
has
taken
an
important
step
in
this
regard

by
establishing
an
executive
leadership
position
in
Equity

Diversity

and
Inclusion
(EDI)
by
appointing
an
Interim
Vice
President

It
is
a
recognition
that
as
an
institution

we
have
more
work
to
do
in
creating
a
more
inclusive
and
just
campus

It
is
also
a
commitment
to
taking
concrete
steps
to
be
better

Representation
of
diversity
at
the
executive
leadership
table
is
an
important
and
overdue
piece
of
the
bigger
picture
for
the
university

Read
more
of
Dr

Beckford's
Statement
Equity
Is
fundamentally
about
fairness

We
will
work
to
ensure
fair
treatment

equitable
access
to
opportunities
and
equitable
treatment
under
our
policies
and
procedures

Diversity
Is
about
the representation
of
difference

We
are
concerned
with
who
is
at
the
table
and
if
the
difference
is
accounted
for

We
will
foster
an
environment
in
which
differences
are
valued

Inclusion
Is
about
belonging

Do
we
all
feel
that
we
are
a
valued
and
respected
part
of
the
organization?
We
will
foster
an
environment
where
everyone
has
a
say

Justice
A
just
campus
is
a
safe
and
secure
place
for
all

with
special
attention
to
the
powerless
and
most
marginalized
and
disadvantaged

This
requires
an
environment
where
policies
and
procedures
are
applied
consistently
and
fairly

I
got
to
where
I
am
today
by
contributing
to
open
source
software

allowing
me
to
not
only
improve
my
skills
as
a
software
developer
but
also
to
increase
my
network
of

and
to
meet
new
and
interesting
friends
from
extremely
diverse
cultures

Guide
on

begins!
The
Tri-Agency
recently
announced
the
new
Tri-Agency
Guide
on
Financial
Information
(TAGFA)
to
be
implemented
at
all
Canadian
universities
with
an
effective
date
of
April
1

2020
 
The
Office
of
the
Vice-President
Research


Innovation

Human
Resources
Office

the
Office
of
Research
Finance
and
the
Office
of
Research
and
Innovation
Services
have
been
working
collectively
over
the
past
several
months
to
prepare
for
implementation
of
the
new
TAGFA

Through
this
collaboration

a
fit-gap
analysis
was
conducted
which
identified
existing
policies
and
procedures
as
well
as
where
we
had
gaps
that
needed
to
be
addressed
 
Staff
have
been
engaged
to
develop
new

or
to
provide
clarity

to
our
Policies
and
Procedures
in
order
to
be
prepared
for
the
full
implementation
of
the
TAGFA
 
Consultations
with
Faculty
and
administrative
support
staff
assisted
us
to
better
understand
the
needs
of
our
research
community
in
managing
Tri-Agency
grants

Whatâ€™s
most
important
about
the
changes
is
the
way
the
Tri-Agency
is
managing
financial
administration?
Previously

the
Tri-Agency
Financial
Administration
Guide
was
very
prescriptive
 
The
transition
to
the
new
TAGFA
will
move
the
responsibilities
of
managing
Tri-Agency
grants
to
institutions
through
a
principle-based
framework
 
 Going
forward

many
of
these
rules
will
be
deferred
to
institutions

subject
to
four
guiding
principles

The
expense
must
contribute
to
the
direct
cost
of
the
research
for
which
funds
were
awarded
The
expense
must
not
normally
be
covered
by
the
institution
The
expense
must
be
effective
and
economical
The
expense
must
not
result
in
personal
gain
for
members
of
the
research
team
Another
important
change
is
that
the
Tri-Agency
will
no
longer
accept
Grant
Amendment
forms
directly
from
researchers

After
April
1

you
must
submit
your
Grant
Amendment
form
to
your
Research
Coordinator
in
the
Office
of
Research
and
Innovation
Services

A
full
guide
to
changes
will
soon
be
available

should
I

Opening
New
Grants
and
Establishing
Signing
Authorities
The Office
of
Research
and
Innovation
Services
(ORIS) is
responsible
for
all
pre-award
manners
related
to
grants

It
is
the
main
contact
for
faculty
members
who
are
in
the
process
of
applying
for
a
grant

Once
a
grant
has
been
awarded
by
the
funding
authority

ORIS
organizes
the
account

ensures
there
is
ethics
approval
in
place
and
instructs
Research
Finance
to
open
the
grant
in
the
Universityâ€™s
financial
system

From
that
point
onwards
the
grant
is
effectively
managed
by
Research
Finance
until
it
ends

ORIS
informs
Research
Finance
when
a
grant
is
ready
to
be
opened

When
Research
Finance
receives
that
notification

the
PI
will
receive
a
letter
informing
them
of
the
grant
number
and
the
budget

You
will
also
be
assigned
a
staff
member
in
the
Office
to
support
you
throughout
your
grant

PIs
are
able
to
grant
signing
authority
for
purchase
orders
and
invoices
to
other
individuals
on
campus
by
completing
the
form
attached
to
the
letter

Even
when
signing
authority
is
assigned

the
PI
is
still
responsible
for
all
charges
incurred

Grant
Signing
Authority
Form
Hiring
Students
for
Research
There
are
a
variety
of
forms
that
are
required
when
hiring
a
student
or
non-student
and
as
for
completing
the
process
to
ensure
that
they
are
paid

The
complete
list
of
information
is
found
on
the
page
-
Grant-Funded
Research
Personnel
on
the
Research
Innovation
website

In
accordance
with
CRA
rules

students
working
on
research
grants
are
paid
as
an
employee
(with
deductions
for
taxes

CPP

and
EI

etc
)

not
via
scholarship

Research
Finance
can
help
you
determine
the
cost
of
hiring
a
student
when
considering
the
cost
of
benefits
(employerâ€™s
amount
of
payroll
taxes)

As
a
general
rule

basic
benefits
that
will
be
charged
to
the
grant
are
charged
at
approximately
10%

your
Research
Grants

externally
funded
grants
require
some
financial
reporting
by
the
University
and/or
require
that
the
University
issue
an
invoice
to
the
granting
agency
in
order
to
receive
payment

Research

the
time
when
you

receive
a

while

whether
youâ€™re

will
allow

to
remember
is
that

Making
unauthorized
modifications
to
the
software
on
an
iPhone
violates
the
iPhone
software
license
agreement

The
common
term
for
modifying
an
iPhone
is
jail-breaking

with
a
particular
emphasis
on
the
second
part
of
that
term

Thatâ€™s
why
we
strongly

almost
emphatically

recommend
that
you
do
not
do
so

Really

Should
you
be
unable
to
use
your
iPhone
due
to
an
unauthorized
software
modification

its
repair
will
not
be
covered
under
the
warranty

Students
learning
computer
science
are
met
with
numerous
challenges
beyond
just
the
course
material

Complex
tooling

confusing
setup

and
overwhelming
systems
can
frustrate
students
and
teachers
alike
before
even
starting
their
coursework

To
explore
these
challenges

we
have
met
with
numerous
students
and
professorsâ€‹
around
the
world
to
explore
these
challenges

Real-world
tools
assume
youâ€™re
a
pro

Professional
developers
like
to
customize
their
tools

so
environments
support
advanced
customizations

without
always
showing
the
quick
and
easy
getting
started
route

Educators
are
oversubscribed

Teachers
need
to
scale
without
sacrificing
quality

Students
are
overwhelmed
without
easy
access
to
help

Friction
with
tools
often
causes
students
to
drop
their
intro
classes

As
a
result

weâ€™re
excited
to
bring
together
Visual
Studio
Code
and
GitHub
Classroom
for
a
seamless
teaching
and
learning
experience
with

aims
to
make
it
as
simple
as
possible
for
students
to
get

with
GitHub

As
a
part
of
this

our
extension
for

provides
a

experience
focused
on
making
it
even
easier
for
students
to
manage
their
assignments

Students
can
either
self-install
the
extension
and
import
their
assignments

or
use
the

experience
from
any
assignment
in
which
a
teacher
enables
Visual

Code
as
an
editor

Once
in
the
extension

students
can
browse
their
code

edit

and
commit
changes

submit
their
assignment

and
see
their
integrated
autograding
results

Also

for
group
projects
and
office
hours

students
can
use
Microsoft
Live
Share
to
collaborate
with
their

Rather
than
spending
a
lot
of
time
in
office
hours
setting
up
student
machines

weâ€™ve
added
an

assignments

Once
a
student
clicks
this

we

handle
installing

It
will
then
open

Navigating
the
University
of
Windsor
campus
is
now
as
simple
as
following
turn-by-turn
directions

The
University
has
launched
â€œCampusGo
â€?
an
all-new
app
that
offers
accurate
and
convenient
wayfinding
of
the
UWindsor
campus

Users
can
quickly
search
and
find
campus
buildings

services

and
selected
classrooms
across
campus
through
the
easy-to-use
app

CampusGoâ€™s
intuitive
interface
also
labels
designated
entrances

exits

and
the
location
of
QR
scanners
in
each
building
as
part
of
the
Universityâ€™s
Return

Campus
health
and
safety
protocols

CampusGo
was
created
by
Mapsted

the
world's
leading
indoor
positioning
system
developers

Indoor
navigation
is
precise
to
within
three
metres
and
requires
no
WIFI
or
GPS
positioning
beacons

The
app
can
be
downloaded
via
the
Google
Play
(Android)
or
App
Store
(iOS)
marketplaces

The
wayfinding
technology
and
interactive
campus
maps
are
also
available
through
any
mobile
or
desktop
web
browser

â€œFinding
a
classroom
in
a
growing
institution
with
over
40
buildings
can
sometimes
be
a
challenge
â€?
says
Jennie
Atkins

who
along
with
Emmeline
Ventimiglia
led
the
project
to
bring
wayfinding
technology
to
the
UWindsor
campus
with
support
and
implementation
from
Facility
Services
and
Information
Technology
teams

â€œWith
CampusGo

you
can
quickly
select
your
desired
destination
and
it
will
provide
turn-by-turn
directions
right
to
the
appropriate
door
â€?
According
to
associate
vice-president
operations
Anna
Kirby

â€œThis
is
incredibly
helpful
given
our
revised
access
to
buildings
and
COVID-19
safety
protocols

CampusGo
will
make
for
a
better
on-campus
experience
for
anyone
who
uses
it
â€?
Campus
accessibility
is
also
promoted
through
CampusGo

Accessible
entrances
and
parking
are
listed

along
with
general
safety
and
convenience
items
such
as
the
location
of
campus
emergency
call
stations
and
visitor
parking

â€œWe
are
very
excited
to
be
working
with
the
University
of
Windsor
to
implement
our
Location
Positioning
Technology
â€?
says
Mapsted
co-founder
and
chief
operating
officer
Saeedeh
Hamidifar

â€œLeveraging
our
patented
machine
learning
and
data
fusion
algorithms
will
elevate
UWindsorâ€™s
experience
for
students
and
visitors
by
enabling
effortless
campus
navigation
â€?
The
app
is
an

what
international

say
about
life
at
the
University
of

The
International
Students
Centre
(ISC)
helped
ease
the
transition
when
coming
to
the
University
of
Windsor

The
ISC
often
hosts
events
for
international
students
to
get
acquainted

share
their
experiences
and
learn
about
Canadian
culture

Staying
in
residence
was
also
helpful
with
the
transition
to
Canada

I
was
able
to
connect
with
other
students
and
get
familiar
with
the
campus

I
even
worked
for
residence
services

This
enhanced
my
communication
skills
and
allowed
me
to
gain
some
valuable
work
experience

Chelsea

I
have
taken
advantage
of
the
services
available
at
the
Student
Success
Centre
by
booking
monthly
appointments
with
my
Academic
Advisors

These
appointments
allowed
me
to
speak
about
my
schedule

courses

and
time
management
strategy

Having
someone
to
follow
up
with
my
progress
was
helpful
because
I
improved
my
skills
through
the
resources
provided

This
is
one
of
the
many
UWindsor
services
that
helped
me
enhance
in
my
academic
experience

My
University
of
Windsor
experience
has
been
exceptional

The
teaching
is
incredible
with
amazing
engineering
facilities
and
superior
support
from
faculty
members

Whether
for
a
final
year
project
or
a
simple
question
in
the
class

a
faculty
member
will
always
be
there
to
help

The
University
of

campus
is
so

that
I
never

like
I'm

I
believe
that
the
University
of
Windsor
prepared
me
for
entering
the
workforce
and
I
credit
the
renowned
co-op
program
for
giving
me
the
skills
and
experience
to
succeed
in
a
post-graduate
world

My
advice
to
incoming
international
students
is
to
make
meaningful
connections
(both
personal
and
professional)
whether
it
be
through
co-op
or
joining
clubs
on
campus

and
take
advantage
of
all
the
resources
the
University
has
to
offer
as
they
will
set
you
up
for
success
in
the
future

I
came
to
the
University
of
Windsor
to
obtain
my
Master
of
Engineering
degree

I
gained
the
necessary
industry
skills
and
knowledge
from
the
courses
that
helped
me
excel
in
my
current
field
of
work

The
resources
that
helped
me
succeed
in
my
university
career
are
the
International
Student
Centre
(ISC)
and
Career
Development
Services
(CDEL)

as
they
assisted
with
work
permits

Visa's
and
strengthening
my
resume
and
cover
letter

My
advice
to
incoming
international
students
is
to
gain
as
much
work
experience
in
Canada
as
possible
and
to
utilize
UWindsor's
on-campus
resources
to
succeed

When
I
was
deciding
where
to
study
in
Canada
it
was
clear
that
studying
at
the
University
of
Windsor
would
be
one
of
the
best
decisions
I
would
ever
make

I
learned
so
much
and
grew
in
many
ways
and
I
look
forward
to
giving
back
to
my
community

I
participated
in
the
Ignite
Work
Study
program
where
I
worked
at
the
International
Student
Centre

This
gave
me
insight
into
a
lot
of
resources
available
at
the
University

I
also
used
the
career
advising
resources
at
the
Odette
School
of
Business

where
I
was
given
the
tools
to
succeed
in
the
Canadian
workplace

My
advice
is
to
ensure
your
resume
and
cover
letter
are
well
written
and
meet
the
Canadian
standard
and
gain
Canadian
work-related
experience
by
volunteering
in
any
capacity

Safety
features

with
important
safety
features

loved
ones

taken
a
hard
fall

If
it
senses
they're
immobile

They

get
help

I

Lin's
sweeping
debut
A
Magic
Steeped

Poison

first
in
a
duology

is

to
enchant
fans
of
Adrienne
Young

Leigh
Bardugo

I
used
to
look
at
my
hands
with
pride

Now
all
I
can
think
is

"These
are
the
hands
that
buried
my
mother
"
For
Ning

the
only
thing
worse
than
losing
her
mother
is
knowing
that
it's
her
own
fault

She
was
the
one
who
unknowingly
brewed
the
poison
tea
that
killed
herâ€”the
poison
tea
that
now
threatens
to
also
take
her
sister

Shu

When
Ning
hears
of
a
competition
to
find
the
kingdom's
greatest
shennong-shiâ€”masters
of
the
ancient
and
magical
art
of
tea-makingâ€”she
travels
to
the
imperial
city
to
compete

The
winner
will
receive
a
favor
from
the
princess

which
may
be
Ning's
only
chance
to
save
her
sister's
life

But
between
the
backstabbing
competitors

bloody
court
politics

and
a
mysterious
(and
handsome)
boy
with
a
shocking
secret

Ning
might
actually
be
the
one
in
more
danger

of

months
of
training
and

have
brought
victories
and

they
have
also
brought
heartbreaking

the
real
battle
lies
ahead

they
must
defeat
Galbatorix

There
will
be
no

The
Rider

anyone
dared
to
hope

But
can
they
topple
the

justice
to

And

Strong
The
University
of
Windsor
is
a
comprehensive

student-focused
university

with
more
than
16
000
students
enrolled
in
a
broad
range
of
undergraduate
and
graduate
programs

including

Engineering
Science
Education
Nursing
Human
Kinetics
Social
Work
Faculty
of
Art

Humanities

and
Social
Sciences
We
have
strong
student-faculty
relationships

exceptional
award-winning
faculty
and
innovative
staff

It
creates
a
unifying
atmosphere
of
excellence
across
all
of
our
faculties
to
encourage
lifelong
learning

teaching

research
and
discovery

The
University
of
Windsor
also
ushered
in
a
new
era
in
September
2015
with
the
opening
of
classes
at
the
first
phase
of
its
downtown
campus
in
the
heart
of
Windsorâ€™s
core

The
new
buildingâ€”which
retains
the
historic
facade
of
the
former
Windsor
Star
newspaper
buildingâ€”houses
the
School
of
Social
Work
and
Continuing
Education

The
second
phase
of
the
downtown
campus
includes
the
School
of
Creative
Arts

located
in
the
century-old
site
of
the
Windsor
Armouries
and
the
Alan
Wildeman
Centre
for
Creative
Arts

The
University
of
Windsor
is
located
next
to
North
Americaâ€™s
busiest
international
border
crossing
and
looks
out
on
one
of
Canadaâ€™s
most
beautiful
waterfronts
on
the
Detroit
River

Windsor
is
also
Canadaâ€™s
southernmost
city
and
has
some
of
the
countryâ€™s
best
weather

This
location
speaks
to
UWindsorâ€™s
strength
as
an
internationally
oriented

multi-disciplined
institution
that
actively
enables
a
broad
diversity
of
students

faculty
and
staff
to
make
a
better
world
through
education

scholarship

research
and
engagement

Its
basic
characteristics
of
openness

warmth

and
support
make
the
University
of
Windsor
an
exceptionally
welcoming
community
for
students
and
faculty
from
Asia

Europe
and
Africaâ€”or
from
just
down
the
street

The
University
receives
revenues
from
a
variety
of
different
sources
all
across
campus

Revenue
is
recorded
in
the
system
in
4
ways
depending
mainly
on
materiality
 
For
the
most
part

each
department
is
responsible
for
recording
their
revenue
whether
that
be
through
an
integrated
system

a
deposit
summary
form

an
invoice
request

a
deposit
form
or
a
journal
entry

Here
are
the
4
ways
Revenue
is
Recorded

Invoices
The
first
way
that
revenue
is
recorded
is
through
an
invoice

This
is
by
far
the
most
preferred
method
for
a
variety
of
reasons

Invoice
forms
should
be
filled
out
in
their
entirety
and
sent
to
ARINV@uwindsor
ca

They
can
be
found
under
AR
Invoice
Request

Research
invoicing
is
sent
to
RESINV@uwindsor
ca
and
should
always
be
sent
to
research
finance
prior
to
sending
to
Accounts
Receivable

The
main
reasons
why
finance
and
your
departments
should
prefer
recording
revenue
through
an
invoice
are

Your
department
receives
the
revenue
in
their
account
as
soon
as
it
is
invoiced
so
you
do
not
have
to
await
payment
before
recording
the
revenue
Follow-up
for
payment
resides
within
the
A/R
department
and
Finance
(unless
additional
support
is
required
and
you
will
be
notified
as
such)
Most
cheques
and
payments
come
directly
to
finance
so
there
is
no
delay
in
the
University
trying
to
apply
payment
to
a
department
they
are
unaware
is
owed
the
money

The
Accounts
Receivable
system
allows
for
more
detailed
information
for
you
and
better
means
of
reporting
for
the
University
as
a
whole

It
is
increasingly
necessary
to
have
accurate
records
of
revenue
received
due
to
our
SMA3
government
funding
metrics

NOTE

It
is
very
important
that
any
invoicing
done
by
ANY
department
at
the
University
be
recorded
through
Accounts
Receivable

There
should
NEVER
be
an
invoice
sent
to
an
external
party
on
behalf
of
the
University
of
Windsor
outside
of
UWinsite
Finance
and
the
A/R
department

Receipts
The
second
way
revenue
is
recorded
is
through
processing
a
receipt
 
This
is
done
when
you
are
receiving
a
cheque and
have
not
previously
invoiced

You
may
receive
cheques
for
a
variety
of
payments
 
Depending
on
your
monthly
volume
of
revenues

you
may
have
been
issued
a
deposit
summary
form
by
the
finance
department
to
be
sent
weekly
to
Accounts
Receivable

If
you
receive
cheques
infrequently
or
smaller
amounts
(below
$10
000
per
month)

you
are
required
to
send
the
money
to
Accounts
Receivable
along
with
a
filled
out
Deposit
form
 
This
can
be
found under Deposit
Funds
 
All
non-cash
deposits
can
be
sent
the
Accounts
Receivable

CHT
4th Floor

Any
cheques
you
receive
that
youâ€™ve
sent
an
invoice
request
in
can
simply
be
forwarded
to
Accounts
Receivable
 
No
forms
are
necessary

Any
cheques
exceeding
$10
000
will
also
be
recorded
as
an
invoice
for
reporting
purposes

NOTE

For
everyoneâ€™s
safety

please
do
not
send
cash
through
inter-office
mail
 Please
note
our Cash
Handling
Policy if
you
have
any
questions
or
concerns

Journal
Entry
or
Deposit
Summary
The
third
way
to
record
revenue
is
through
a
journal
entry
or
deposit
summary
 
This
would
apply
to
those
departments
that
have
applied
for
their
own
deposit
forms
with
brinks
night
deposit
bags
and/or
have
their
own
POS
machines
 
Your
deposit
will
be
done
through
a
deposit
summary
(which
finance
would
provide)
if
the
volume
of
revenue
exceeds
$10
000
per
month
on
average
 
Otherwise

for
each
deposit
form
a
journal
entry
form
will
need
to
be
submitted
preferably
within
5
business
days
and/or
4
days
after
the
end
of
the
month
to
ensure
it
is
recorded
as
revenue
in
the
appropriate
month
and
matches
the
bank
activity

The
journal
entry
form
can
be
found here
 
You
may
also
be
required
to
do
a
journal
entry
for
any
items
received
through
EFT
payments
 
***
NOTE
â€“
All
remittances
should
at
a
minimum
be
copied
to eftpmt@uwindsor
ca
 
A
remittance
is
a
notification
from
the
party
you
will
be
receiving
money
from
that
notifies
you
that
the
money
has
been
deposited/sent

Integration
of
External
Systems
The
fourth
way
and
the
most
efficient
is
through
an
integration
of
any
external
systems
 
This
would
include
ecommerce
websites

Azzier
work
order

Activenet

etc
 
These
items
flow
through
nightly
in
most
cases
automatically
and
get
posted
as
a
journal
entry

 
Please
keep
in
mind

if
you
are
expecting
a
payment
large
or
small
through
EFT

please
email
eftpmt@uwindsor
ca
to
ensure
we
know
who
the
item
belongs
to
and
can
watch
for
it
for
you
 
The
University
receives
thousands
of
transactions
daily
through
our
banks
and
we
rely
on
each
department
to
remain
up
to
date
on
their
revenue
recordings
received
in
the
bank

We
are
happy
to
assist
you
with
any
tax
implications
for
