If your trade-in device is eligible for credit, you can offset the purchase price of a new one. If itâ€™s not eligible for credit, you can recycle it for free. How does it work? Whether youâ€™re making a purchase or not, weâ€™ve made it easy to trade in an eligible device either in a store or online. Just answer a few questions regarding the brand, model, and condition of your device. Weâ€™ll provide an estimated trade-in value or a simple way to recycle it. If you accept the trade-in estimate in the store, weâ€™ll give you instant credit toward a purchase or a gift card you can use anytime. If you accept the trade-in estimate online when you purchase a new Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, weâ€™ll arrange for you to send us your current device. Once we receive it, weâ€™ll inspect it and verify its condition. If everything checks out, weâ€™ll credit your original purchase method and send you any remaining balance on an Apple Gift Card via email. If you choose to trade in your current device online for a gift card, weâ€™ll also arrange for you to send it to us. When everything checks out, weâ€™ll send you an Apple Gift Card via email. Regardless of how you choose to trade in, if the condition of your device doesnâ€™t match what you described, a new estimated trade-in value will be provided. Youâ€™ll have the option to either accept this revised quote or reject it. If you reject it, your device will be returned to you at no charge. Should I choose credit toward a purchase or an Apple Store Gift Card? It depends on where and when you make a purchase. If youâ€™re ready to buy a new product at an Apple Store, you can bring your old device with you. If itâ€™s eligible for trade-in, weâ€™ll apply an instant credit at the time of purchase. If youâ€™re ready to buy a new Apple product online (apple.com (Opens in a new window) or the Apple Store app), you can trade in an old device and get credit toward your purchase. If youâ€™re not ready to make a purchase, you can trade in your old device online for an Apple Gift Card via email that you can apply to any future Apple purchase. And no matter how you use Apple Trade In, if your device has no trade-in value, you can always recycle it responsibly for free. How long does the online trade-in process take? Generally it takes 2â€“3 weeks. But the sooner we receive your device, the sooner we can verify its condition and process your credit or gift card. Recycling a device is much faster. As soon as we email you a prepaid shipping label, just send your device to our recycling partner. If I buy a new device online with a trade-in, what kind of credit will I get? It depends on what you buy and how you pay for it. If you buy an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch and pay in full, weâ€™ll apply a credit to your original payment method up to the total purchase price. For any remaining amount, youâ€™ll receive an Apple Gift Card via email. If you buy an iPhone using Apple Card Monthly Installments, Apple iPhone Payments, or the Verizon Device Payment Program and include a trade-in, your estimated trade-in credit will be applied directly to the purchase price of your new iPhone. Once we receive your trade-in device and confirm that the condition matches what you described, thereâ€™s nothing more you need to do. If it doesnâ€™t match, your original payment method will be charged the difference in value. In that case, weâ€™ll work with you to confirm that you still want to move forward with the trade-in. Can I see what my device is worth online, then bring it with me when I buy a new device in the store? Yes, the Apple Trade In program is available on apple.com (Opens in a new window) as well as in all our retail stores. However, keep in mind that the trade-in credit you get in the store may be different from the estimated trade-in value you received online. How much will I get for my trade-in? It depends on the device, model, manufacturer, and condition. Answer a few questions accurately, and once we receive the device within the specified time frame and verify its condition, youâ€™ll most likely receive the full amount of the estimated refund. Keep in mind that we need to receive your device within 14 days of initiating the trade-in, and the condition needs to match what you told us. If the condition of the device is different from what you described, weâ€™ll provide a revised value. You can either accept or reject it. If you accept it, weâ€™ll continue with the trade-in and either charge or credit the difference in value to the card you provided. If you reject it, weâ€™ll cancel the trade-in, return your current device, and charge the original trade-in value to your card. No matter what, weâ€™ll send you email updates about the progress of your trade-in, so youâ€™ll know whatâ€™s happening at every step. Does Apple offer recycling? Yes.
