It creates a unifying atmosphere of excellence across all of our faculties to encourage lifelong learning, teaching, research and discovery. The University of Windsor also ushered in a new era in September 2015 with the opening of classes at the first phase of its downtown campus in the heart of Windsorâ€™s core. The new buildingâ€”which retains the historic facade of the former Windsor Star newspaper buildingâ€”houses the School of Social Work and Continuing Education. The second phase of the downtown campus includes the School of Creative Arts, located in the century-old site of the Windsor Armouries and the Alan Wildeman Centre for Creative Arts. The University of Windsor is located next to North Americaâ€™s busiest international border crossing and looks out on one of Canadaâ€™s most beautiful waterfronts on the Detroit River. Windsor is also Canadaâ€™s southernmost city and has some of the countryâ€™s best weather. This location speaks to UWindsorâ€™s strength as an internationally oriented, multi-disciplined institution that actively enables a broad diversity of students, faculty and staff to make a better world through education, scholarship, research and engagement. Its basic characteristics of openness, warmth, and support make the University of Windsor an exceptionally welcoming community for students and faculty from Asia, Europe and Africaâ€”or from just down the street.
