Based on a true story. In 1937 in the snowbound city of Kiev (now known as Kyiv), wry and bookish history student Mila Pavlichenko organizes her life around her library job and her young sonâ€”but Hitlerâ€™s invasion of Ukraine and Russia sends her on a different path. Given a rifle and sent to join the fight, Mila must forge herself from studious girl to deadly sniperâ€”a lethal hunter of Nazis known as Lady Death. When news of her three hundredth kill makes her a national heroine, Mila finds herself torn from the bloody battlefields of the eastern front and sent to America on a goodwill tour. Still reeling from war wounds and devastated by loss, Mila finds herself isolated and lonely in the glittering world of Washington, DCâ€”until an unexpected friendship with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and an even more unexpected connection with a silent fellow sniper offer the possibility of happiness. But when an old enemy from Milaâ€™s past joins forces with a deadly new foe lurking in the shadows, Lady Death finds herself battling her own demons and enemy bullets in the deadliest duel of her life. Based on a true story, The Diamond Eye is a haunting novel of heroism born of desperation, of a mother who became a soldier, of a woman who found her place in the world and changed the course of history forever. $14.99 Sylvanas (World of Warcraft) Book 4 NATIONAL BESTSELLER â€¢ The epic, definitive story of Sylvanas Windrunner, one of World of Warcraftâ€™s most enduring and iconic characters, as chronicled by bestselling author Christie Golden.Â  Ranger-General.

(Steve Berry, New York Times bestselling author) about a relentlessly twisty murder mystery. No one mourned when San Francisco DA Wes Farrell put Paul Riley in prison eleven years ago for the rape and murder of his girlfriend. And no one is particularly happy to see him again when heâ€™s released after The Exoneration Initiative uncovered evidence that pinned the crime on someone else. In fact, Riley soon turns up murdered, surrounded by the loot from his latest scam. But if Riley was really innocent all along, who wanted him dead? To the cops, itâ€™s straightforward: the still-grieving father of Rileyâ€™s dead girlfriend killed the former prisoner. Farrell, now out of politics and practicing law with master attorney Dismas Hardy, agrees to represent the defendant, Doug Rushâ€”and is left in the dust when Rush suddenly vanishes. At a loss, Farrell and Hardy ask PI Abe Glitsky to track down the potentially lethal defendant. The search takes Glitsky through an investigative hall of mirrors populated by wounded parents, crooked cops, cheating spouses, and single-minded vigilantes. As Glitsky embraces and then discards one enticing theory after another, the truth seems to recede ever farther. So far that he begins to question his own moral compass in this â€œsuperb thriller from a veteran crime writerâ€? (Jeffrey Deaver, New York Times bestselling author) that youâ€™ll savor to the last word. $17.99 Sea of Tranquility: A Novel Emily St. John Mandel From the #1 bestselling author of the Scotiabank Giller Prizeâ€“shortlisted The Glass Hotel and the internationally bestselling Station Eleven comes a new novel of dazzling imagination In this captivating tale of imagination and ambition, a seemingly disparate array of people come into contact with a time traveller who must resist the pull to change the past and the future.

Blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, Emily St. John Mandelâ€™s dazzling story follows these engrossing characters across space and time as their lives ultimately intersect.

The Medlar Three, as they are known around town, have sworn off getting involved in any more murder investigations. When the sheriff unexpectedly leaves on vacation, Jack is surprised to find himself appointed as deputy. So when Kate stumbles upon a dead body while visiting a friend, the Medlar Three are back in the sleuthing game. Kate also has a charming new real estate client with a mysterious past.

A Medlar Mystery Book 1: A Willing Murder Book 2: A Justified Murder Book 3: A Forgotten Murder Book 4: A Relative Murder $16.99 Ten Steps to Nanette: A Memoir Situation Hannah Gadsby NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â€¢ Multi-award-winning Hannah Gadsby broke comedy with her show Nanette when she declared that she was quitting stand-up. Now she takes us through the defining moments in her life that led to the creation of Nanette and her powerful decision to tell the truthâ€”no matter the cost. â€œHannah is a Promethean force, a revolutionary talent. This hilarious, touching, and sometimes tragic book is all about where her fires were lit.â€?â€”Emma Thompson ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022â€”Entertainment Weekly, PopSugar â€œThere is nothing stronger than a broken woman who has rebuilt herself,â€?Â Hannah Gadsby declared in her show Nanette, a scorching critique of the way society conducts public debates about marginalized communities. When it premiered on Netflix, it left audiences captivated by her blistering honesty and her singular ability to take them from rolling laughter to devastated silence. Ten Steps to Nanette continues Gadsbyâ€™s tradition of confounding expectations and norms, properly introducing us to one of the most explosive, formative voices of our time. Gadsby grew upÂ as the youngest of five childrenÂ in an isolated town in Tasmania, whereÂ homosexuality was illegal until 1997. She perceived her childhood as safe and â€œnormal,â€? but as she gained an awareness of her burgeoning queerness, the outside world began to undermine the â€œvulnerably thin veneerâ€? of her existence. After moving to mainland Australia and receiving aÂ degreeÂ in art history, Gadsby found herself adrift, working itinerant jobs and enduring years of isolation punctuated by homophobic and sexual violence. At age twenty-seven, without a home or the ability to imagine her own future, she was urged by a friend to enter aÂ stand-upÂ competition. She won, and so began her career in comedy.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Gadsby became well known for her self-deprecating, autobiographical humor that made her the butt of her own jokes. But in 2015, as Australia debated the legality of same-sex marriage, Gadsby started to question this mode of storytelling, beginning work on a show that would become â€œthe most-talked-about, written-about, shared-about comedy act in yearsâ€? (The New York Times).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Harrowing and hilarious, Ten Steps to Nanette traces Gadsbyâ€™s growth as a queer person, to her ever-evolving relationship with comedy,Â andÂ her struggle with late-in-life diagnoses of autism and ADHD, finallyÂ arriving atÂ the backbone of Nanette: the renouncement of self-deprecation, the rejection of misogyny, and the moral significance of truth-telling. $16.99 The Marquess Makes His Move Book 3 Diana Quincy returns with the newest novel in the Clandestine Affairs series with a steamy romance about a half-Arab marquess seeking revenge onâ€”and falling forâ€”Londonâ€™s most famous mapmaker.

If anyone discovers that Rose Fleming is the power and talent behind the family business, the scandal could ruin them. Roseâ€™s secret is tested by the arrival of a handsome new footman who shows far too much interest in his new mistress. RoseÂ battles an intense attraction to the enigmatic servant, but maintaining a proper distance isnâ€™t easy when you and temptation live under the same roof.Â  She makes him forget he has a score to settleâ€¦ Few have met the reclusive half-Arab Marquess of Brandon, who is rumored to live with a harem of beauties among his motherâ€™s people near Jerusalem. Brandon couldnâ€™t care less what society thinks of him, or that his fellow peers are disdainful of his common blood, but he wonâ€™t stand for being robbed. Thatâ€™s why he's disguised himself as a footman in the home of a respected mapmaker who cheated Brandon out of his land. But the nobleman's plans for retribution are complicated by his growing attraction for the secretive lady of the house. When Brandon uncovers the shocking truth about Roseâ€™s role in his stolen birthright, can a love born of deception really conquer all?Â  $11.99 The Modern Singhs: The true story of a marriage of two cultures Abbey Singh Abbey and Money Singh are better known as The Modern Singhs, Kiwi social media celebrities with a rich and tangled love story to tell.

Not for the squeamish or the easily offended, Berserk asks for no quarter - and offers none! His name is Guts, the Black Swordsman, a feared warrior spoken of only in whispers. Bearer of a gigantic sword, an iron hand, and the scars of countless battles and tortures, his flesh is also indelibly marked with The Brand, an unholy symbol that draws the forces of darkness to him and dooms him as their sacrifice. But Guts won't take his fate lying down; he'll cut a crimson swath of carnage through the ranks of the damned - and anyone else foolish enough to oppose him! Accompanied by Puck the Elf, more an annoyance than a companion, Guts relentlessly follows a dark, bloodstained path that leads only to death...or vengeance. $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 4 Now that the evil Count has been killed and dragged to Hell by the demon lords of the Godhand, Guts, the Black Swordsman, hooks up with his former benefactor, the mercenary Gambino. But itâ€™s a deadly reunion, one that nearly takes Gutsâ€™ life. The following years see Guts wandering from battlefield to battlefield, where his awesome skills as a slayer catch the eye of both warring parties, including the legendary Griffith, warrior leader of the Band of the Hawk, who is eager to test his combat skills against those of the Black Swordsman. As usual, anytime that Guts is involved there will be hell to pay! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 3 Guts, the feared Black Swordsman, finishes his desperate battle with the monstrous Count, cutting and blasting him to gory scraps when the presence of the Count's daughter makes the monster hesitate. But Guts won't even have the time to clean his gigantic sword when the Count's dying pleas activate the Behelit, summoning the five God Hands, demon lords of immeasurable power. Guts' journey so far has been a long road of pain and death, but that's a walk in the park compared to fighting his way out of Hell itself! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 2 The evil Count uses his dark powers to transform a defeated guard captain into an inhuman horror to combat Guts, the Black Swordsman. Puck, Gutsâ€™ pint-sized fairy sidekick, is captured when he attempts to stop an old doctorâ€™s execution, and he is given as a gift to the countâ€™s daughter, a sweet girl in a gilded cage, imprisoned by her father in her own room. Guts, determined to make mincemeat of the Count, assaults the castle and carves a swath of blood-soaked destruction through the Countâ€™s minions. Face-to-face with the Black Swordsman at last, the Count reveals his true form, and even Gutsâ€™ super-sized sword may not be big enough to contend with this demonic monstrosity! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 7 Two feudal kingdoms, Midland and Chuder, battle for supremacy in what will become the final clash in a century-long struggle. Spearheading the Midland forces is the Band of the Hawk, a legendary cadre of elite mercenaries led by the charismatic Griffith and with the fearless Guts as its berserker champion. The Hawks' ferocity, courage, and fearsome skills - not to mention Guts' enormous broadsword - are just what Midland needs to turn the bloody tide, but during the fray, Guts and Griffith's most trusted lieutenant, Casca, fall together from a cliff into a raging river. Miraculously, both barely survive, and Guts tends to Casca's wounds as she tells of having her life saved by Griffith, her induction into the Band of the Hawk, and her deep feelings toward Griffith. She even seems to finally be warming up to the grim Guts. But this greeting-card moment won't last long, for Chuder warriors are on the prowl, and the only greetings they carry are on the points of their spears! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 9 Griffith, charismatic leader of the elite mercenary Band of the Hawk, has seen better days. His fearless champion, Guts, has left the Band, defeating Griffith in personal combat as his ticket out. With his judgment clouded by this unthinkable humiliation, Griffith eases his pain in the arms of the daughter of Midlandâ€™s king. But the King doesnâ€™t take kindly to an employee picking the royal flowers, and the next stop for Griffith is the dungeon and the torture rack! Without Griffith and Guts, the Hawks become easy prey for Midlandâ€™s army, and the AWOL Guts may be the only answer to the Hawks' â€” and Griffithâ€™s â€” lethal problems. $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 6 Back in the day, Guts the Black Swordsman was a top slayer for The Band of the Hawk, an elite mercenary unit led by Griffith, whose calm demeanor and callow beauty belied his fighting prowess and steel will. While in a kingâ€™s employ, the attraction between the kingâ€™s daughter and Griffith and the growing favor of the king towards the Hawk leader raises the hackles of the kingâ€™s jealous son, who plots to have Griffith summarily assassinated. But if the plot fails, the kingâ€™s son will likely have to deal with Guts and his titanic broadsword, and the results of such confrontations are rarely pretty... or easy to clean up. $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 13 The Band of the Hawk may have been the most formidable band of fighters around, but when matched up against an army of abyssal monstrosities, earthly fighting skills donâ€™t amount to a hill of beans. The Hawksâ€™ tortured and mutilated former leader, Griffith, has used the accursed Crimson Behelit to open the gates to a shadowy realm of unspeakable horrors, the realm of the demon lords of the Godhand, who are willing to transform Griffith into a being of terrible power and majesty as long as Griffith is willing to give up his former command as sacrifices in the Invocation of Doom. But nobody takes down the Hawks without a fight, and their berserker champion, Guts, will take on anything Hell can throw at him in order to save his lover, Casca, from the sordid violations that only Hell can offer. $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 14 The once unbeatable Band of the Hawk is smashed, and their former leader, Griffith, has made an unholy pact with the demon lords of the Godhand, sacrificing his former troops to resurrect his crippled body and ascend to stand in power beside these profane gods. The Invocation of Doom has unleashed a plague of unspeakable horrors upon the earth, and the first battle not only shatters the Hawks, but the hand of their champion, Guts, and the mind of their captain and Gutsâ€™ lover, Casca. And while time may heal some of Gutsâ€™ wounds, it will not heal his desire for vengeance. And his discovery of a gigantic, dragon-slaying sword might be just the ticket to deal out some king-sized payback! Also included in this volume: "Berserk Prototype," the very first Berserk story, created during Kentaro Miuraâ€™s college days as his audition that sold the series! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 5 He is Guts, the Black Swordsman, a warrior of legendary prowess â€” relentless, fearless, merciless. As cold and brutal as the iron of the massive sword he wields. Bent on revenge against the unholy forces that have branded him for sacrifice, but especially on Griffith, one of the demon lords of the Godhand. But Griffith was once a man, the leader of the Hawks, a renowned cadre of elite fighters with a young Guts as its fiercest champion. Though forged in a crucible of cruelty and violence, nothing could prepare Guts for a confrontation with Nosferatu Zodd, a superhuman beast who slaughters Gutsâ€™ comrades as easily as a scythe cuts wheat. Even Guts and Griffith are no match for the abominationâ€™s power...but something Griffith wears around his neck may well be! $12.99$3.99 Advice for a better life See more Untamed Glennon Doyle #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â€¢ Over two million copies sold! â€œPacked with incredible insight about what it means to be a woman today.â€?â€”Reese Witherspoon (Reeseâ€™s Book Club Pick) In her most revealing and powerful memoir yet,Â the activist, speaker, bestselling author, and â€œpatron saint of female empowermentâ€? (People) explores the joy and peace we discover when weÂ stop striving to meet othersâ€™ expectations and start trusting the voice deep within us. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY O: The Oprah Magazine â€¢ The Washington Post â€¢ Cosmopolitan â€¢ Marie Claire â€¢ Bloomberg â€¢ Parade â€¢ â€œUntamed will liberate womenâ€”emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It is phenomenal.â€?â€”Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray Love This is how you find yourself. There is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasnâ€™t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontentâ€”even from ourselves. For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voiceâ€”the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the worldâ€™s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story ofÂ navigating divorce, forming aÂ new blended family,Â and discovering thatÂ theÂ brokenness or wholeness of a family depends notÂ on itsÂ structure butÂ onÂ each memberâ€™s ability toÂ bringÂ herÂ fullÂ self to the table.Â And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is. Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get. $16.99 Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World Admiral William H.

For decades, weâ€™ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Letâ€™s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesnâ€™t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it isâ€”a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, letâ€™s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limitedâ€”"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. $12.99 Alcoholics Anonymous, Fourth Edition: The official "Big Book" from Alcoholic Anonymous Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. Known as the "Big Book," the basic text of Alcoholics Anonymous has helped millions of people worldwide get and stay sober since the first edition appeared in 1939.

Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smithâ€™s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic taleâ€”but itâ€™s only half the story. Â  Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.Â  Â  This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself. $16.99 Top-sellers under $10 See more Dune Messiah Book 2 Book Two in the Magnificent Dune Chroniclesâ€”the Bestselling Science Fiction Adventure of All Time Dune Messiah continues the story of Paul Atreides, better knownâ€”and fearedâ€”as the man christened Muadâ€™Dib.

Instead, DEA K-9 agent Adam â€œDeckâ€? Decker watches in horror as one Denver hospital seems to be Ground Zero for overdoses of a new drug. Now Deck can only hope a certain icy, green-eyed ER doctor will help him and his canine partner track down the deadly source. Dr. Tori Sampson has her reasons for not trusting federal agents, especially ones working for the DEA. But the rash of overdosesâ€”including a heartbreaking case involving a teenâ€”is alarmingly high. And the new opioid is not only extremely dangerous, it defies all the usual medical treatments. So Tori has a choice: work with the big, brawny, and annoyingly hot DEA agent...or watch more innocent people die. Toriâ€™s the only person who can help Deck break the case, and theyâ€™ll need to trust each other, no matter how high the tension and attraction sizzling between them runs. But with every question answered, they realize thereâ€™s something more behind these typical teen overdoses. Thereâ€™s a pattern here, and a pattern can only suggest one thing.

But since she has no intention of marrying, she visits a costume emporium specifically to order unflattering dresses guaranteed to put off any prospective suitors.

Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchasesâ€”a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old. It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practiceâ€”with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson planâ€”from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...

(Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Â  Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Â  Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the worldâ€™s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barberâ€™s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming â€œunstuck in time.â€? An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegutâ€™s writingâ€”the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive witâ€”that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim Oâ€™Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegutâ€™s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as â€œthe kind of writer who made peopleâ€”young people especiallyâ€”want to write.â€? George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be â€œthe great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.â€? Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own eraâ€™s uncertainties. â€œPoignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.â€?â€”The Boston Globe $8.99 Moon Knight (2014-): Dead Will Rise Vol 2, #7-12 Â‘Season Two' begins with a new creative team - and a blackout!

Sun Tzu believed war to be an essential wrongdoing that must be got rid of whenever it can be. The war should be fought fleetingly to reduce economic decline. Sun Tzu harped on the significance of placement in military tactics. The planning to position an army must be dependent on the stipulations in the physical surroundings and the subjective thoughts of various militants in those conditions. He believed that strategy cannot be considered as planning with respect to glancing through a previously decided list. It is better represented by the fact that it needs speedy and suitable reactions to altering situations. Planning gives results in restrained surroundings. But in case of an altering environment, similar plans come in each otherâ€™s ways and give rise to undesired outcomes. The book has been a profound factor in the workings of Eastern and Western military strategies, business planning, legal thought processes, and more.

In the early 2000s, many people in El Salvador were at first excited by the prospect of jobs, progress, and prosperity that the Pacific Rim mining company promised. However, farmer Vidalina Morales, brothers Marcelo and Miguel Rivera, and others soon discovered that the river system supplying water to the majority of Salvadorans was in danger of catastrophic contamination. With a group of unlikely allies, local and global, they committed to stop the corporation and the destruction of their home. Based on over a decade of research and their own role as international allies of the community groups in El Salvador, Robin Broad and John Cavanagh unspool this untold storyâ€”a tale replete with corporate greed, a transnational lawsuit at a secretive World Bank tribunal in Washington, violent threats, murders, andâ€”surprisinglyâ€”victory. The husband-and-wife duo immerses the reader in the lives of the Salvadoran villagers, the journeys of the local activists who sought the truth about the effects of gold mining on the environment, and the behind-the-scenes maneuverings of the corporate mining executives and their lawyers. The Water Defenders demands that we examine our assumptions about progress and prosperity, while providing valuable lessons for those fighting against destructive corporations in the United States and across the world. $36.95$19.95 Start a new series See more Berserk Vol 1 Created by Kentaro Miura, Berserk is manga mayhem to the extreme - violent, horrifying, and mercilessly funny - and the wellspring for the internationally popular anime series.

They target the worst of societyâ€”rapists, murderers, and thievesâ€”and then use their unlimited resources to offset the damage done by those who theyâ€™ve killed, donating untraceable bitcoin to charities and victims via the dark net. The Five soon become the most popular figures on social media, a modern-day Batmanâ€¦though their motives may not be entirely pure. After a woman is murdered in the Twin Cities, Virgil Flowers and Lucas Davenport are sent in to investigate. And they soon have their hands full--the killings are smart and carefully choreographed, and with no apparent direct connection to the victims, the Five are virtually untraceable. But if anyone can destroy this group, it will be the dynamic team of Davenport and Flowers. $16.99 A Sunlit Weapon: A Novel Book 17 In the latest installment of the New York Times bestselling series, a series of possible attacks on British pilots leads Jacqueline Winspear's beloved heroine Maisie Dobbs into a mystery involving First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
