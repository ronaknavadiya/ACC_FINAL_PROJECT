Graphical Depiction of the Project Justification Process Appendix C: Accessibility requirements Providing information and services through mobile devices is an important part of the Government of Canada's commitment to multi-channel access and service delivery. The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that a high level of accessibility is applied uniformly across device-based mobile applications. Mobile technologies and standards are constantly evolving and accessibility plays a major role in making Government of Canada service delivery more effective and inclusive. To meet the Government of Canada commitment to accessibility, the Government of Canada has adopted WCAG 2.0 for device-based mobile applications. WCAG 2.0 states: "Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general." Managers, functional specialists, and equivalents responsible for device-based mobile applications are responsible for: Ensuring that each device-based mobile application meets all five WCAG 2.0 conformance requirements. For the purposes of this standard, requirements that apply to Web pages equally apply to device-based mobile applications screens. Conformance requirement 1 (Conformance level) defines the levels of conformance. It can be met only if the following are true: Level AA conformance is met in full. Common failures are avoided for all applicable success criteria. Sufficient techniques are used to meet all applicable success criteria. Sufficient techniques specific to each technology (that is relied upon) are used where applicable. Conformance requirement 2 (Full pages) defines what needs to be assessed for a device-based mobile application. Conformance requirement 3 (Complete processes) defines what needs to be assessed for a device-based mobile application that is part of a process. Conformance requirement 4 (Only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies) defines the ways of using technologies that can be relied upon to satisfy the success criteria. It can be met only by use of the following technologies: HTML5 or later excluding obsolete features; Technologies with sufficient techniques (specific to each technology) to meet all applicable success criteria; or Technologies native to the supported mobile operating systems. Conformance requirement 5 (Non-interference) defines requirements for ways of using technologies that are not relied upon to satisfy the success criteria. List of exclusions The following exclusions from specific requirements have been put in place for a period of time and will be updated annually as technology advances. Exclusions include: Content Requirements Complex maps (text alternatives) WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text content Live video captions (closed captions) WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 1.2.4 Captions (live) Audio description (pre-recorded video) except where the video provides information related to the health and safety of Canadians WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 1.2.5 Audio description Exclusions for a 10 business day grace period: Pre-recorded videos have a 10 business day grace period from the time of publication to when closed captions and transcription of videos must be provided. Live video captions exclusions refer to closed captioning and transcription of live video. Audio description (pre-recorded videos) is required only for videos that relate to the health and safety of Canadians; for other pre-recorded videos, audio description is not required. Complex maps: A map that associates information with one or more locations that cannot be represented by postal addresses or proper names such as intersections, landmarks, cities, or regions. An example of a complex map is one that shows the location and intensity of precipitation detected by a radar network. Two clarifications: "Essential" images of text are defined as logos, brand names and advertisements for government initiatives and marketing campaigns. As per WCAG 2.0, these "essential" images of text are not required to meet WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of text. WCAG 2.0 allows multiple versions of content (including videos) to be made available; however, there must be at least one version (conforming alternate version) that complies with WCAG 2.0. Appendix D: Usability requirements This appendix prescribes the mandatory elements that apply to device-based mobile applications. Common layout and design across device-based mobile applications, where appropriate, results in an appropriate degree of consistency. This consistency helps users anticipate how to interact with these services while giving departments the flexibility to use evolving technologies and to develop device-based mobile applications for their target audiences, information, and services. For the purposes of this standard, usability is defined as the extent to which specified users can find, understand and utilize information and services through device-based mobile applications. Usability can be measured through the effectiveness and efficiency with which users can complete defined tasks through device-based mobile applications,Â i.e.: Ensuring that websites and Web applications contain the mandatory elements described in this appendix's "Mandatory elements for device-based mobile applications" section; Ensuring that device-based mobile applications meet the requirements for global notices described in this appendix's "Global notices" section; Ensuring that device-based mobile applications meet the requirements for context-sensitive notices described in this appendix's "Context-sensitive notices" section; Provides the End User Licence Agreement, or a mechanism for accessing it, in the main corporate store for each supported mobile operating system; and Displays the notices in this appendix's "Context-sensitive notices" section where appropriate. Mandatory elements for device-based mobile applications The following elements are mandatory for each device-based mobile application: The Government of Canada signature and the Canada Wordmark, with the following exceptions: Departments identified by the Arms of Canada use the Government of Canada signature or their approved Arms of Canada signature.

User-Centred Design The following requirements ensure that users can find, understand and utilize the information and services provided through device-based mobile applications with effectiveness and efficiency. Managers, functional specialists, content owners and equivalents are responsible for ensuring that, for device-based mobile applications: User research methods are used to define: The users of the device-based mobile application; The tasks the users will accomplish using the device-based mobile application; and The contexts in which the users will use the device-based mobile application to accomplish their tasks. The users, their tasks and the contexts in which the users accomplish their tasks form the basis for the design of the mobile application. The device-based mobile application is designed iteratively; the design process starts with low-fidelity methods, such as mock-ups, and progressively moves to higher-fidelity methods, such as prototypes. The design of the device-based mobile application is regularly evaluated and improved through usability testing, such as observing users completing tasks, with actual users throughout its lifecycle. The design of the device-based mobile application takes into consideration the other service channels, such as telephone and in-person, used to obtain information and services from the Government of Canada. Appendix E: Interoperability requirements Providing information and services through mobile devices is an important part of the Government of Canada's commitment to multi-channel access and service delivery. AsÂ Canadians are becoming increasingly reliant upon mobile devices and data-centric technologies, the Government of Canada is committed to ensuring the reuse and the portability of information and services across applications, platforms and devices. For the purposes of this standard, interoperability is defined as the ability of different types of platforms, devices, networks and applications to work together effectively, without prior communication, to find, retrieve, exchange and re-use content in a useful and meaningful manner. Managers, functional specialists, and equivalents responsible for device-based mobile applications are responsible for: Ensuring that text-based resources of device-based mobile applications, such as HTML, XML and CSS, are encoded in UTF-8. Ensuring that parts of device-based mobile applications that are in HTML or XHTML: Â Are built using HTML5 or later. HTML5 can also be written in XHTML syntax, known as XHTML5; and Apply HTML5 elements and "rel attribute" values according to the HTML5 specification. Appendix F: Publishing requirements Government of Canada departments offer a wide variety of informational and transactional services for individuals and businesses through multiple channels. In the case of device-based mobile applications, they are offered through the main corporate store of each supported mobile operating system. Publishing device-based mobile applications together makes it easier for users to both find and recognize Government of Canada device-based mobile applications in these main corporate stores. In addition, it will help reduce departmental costs for publishing the device-based mobile applications. The department mandated as the Government of Canada publishing entity is responsible for publishing all device-based mobile applications on behalf of each department, while each department is accountable for its own mobile applications. Managers, functional specialists and equivalents responsible for device-based mobile applications are responsible for: Ensuring that each device-based mobile application is published through the department mandated as the Government of Canada publishing entity.
