Â  What information is collected when a company uses Adobe Experience Cloud? When a company uses Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, that company chooses how to use the solutions, including what information to collect and send to its Adobe Experience Cloud account.

Cookies and Similar Technologies. Adobe Experience Cloud solutions useÂ cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to enable companies to collect information in connection with their websites. If you look at your cookie settings in your browser, you may notice cookies from Adobe-owned domains, such as omtrdc.net and demdex.net. Most Internet browsers classify these as "third-party cookiesâ€? because they are not set by the website you are visiting. Companies using the Adobe Experience Cloud sometimes choose to use their own cookies (often called "first-party cookiesâ€?). Mobile. A company may also use Adobe Experience Cloud technologies within its mobile apps. These technologies allow the company to send information to its Adobe Experience Cloud account -- for example, how you use the companyâ€™s mobile apps as well as other information your mobile device may make available to apps, such as location information.

In either scenario, the hosted server(s) to which the tags are delivered are not owned or managed by Adobe nor does Adobe own the server logs for requests made to those servers.

But no personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or phone number is shared with the Co-op.Â  The Co-op then combines and processes the technical information to recognize when multiple devices are used by the same individual (who is not personally identifiable by the Co-op), and creates links among those devices.
