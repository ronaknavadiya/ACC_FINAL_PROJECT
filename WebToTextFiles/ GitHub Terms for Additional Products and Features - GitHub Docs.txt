Â  GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features In this article Actions Advanced Security Advisory Database Codespaces Connect GitHub Enterprise Importer Learning Lab npm Packages Pages Previews Sponsors Program SQL Server Images Version Effective Date: August 10, 2021 When you use GitHub, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features ("Additional Products and Features"). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, specific terms for that product or feature may apply in addition to your main agreement with usâ€”the GitHub Terms of Service, GitHub Corporate Terms of Service, GitHub General Terms, or Microsoft volume licensing agreement (each, the "Agreement"). Below, we've listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them. By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these GitHub terms for Additional Product and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement. For Enterprise users GitHub Enterprise Cloud users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Codespaces, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Learning Lab, Packages, and Pages. GitHub Enterprise Server users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Learning Lab, Packages, Pages, and SQL Server Images. GitHub AE users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages and Pages. Actions GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Actions is billed on a usage basis. The Actions documentation includes details, including compute and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Actions minutes usage and set usage limits. Actions and any elements of the Actions product or service may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the GitHub Acceptable Use Polices, or the GitHub Actions service limitations set forth in the Actions documentation. Additionally, regardless of whether an Action is using self-hosted runners, Actions should not be used for: cryptomining; disrupting, gaining, or attempting to gain unauthorized access to, any service, device, data, account, or network (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program); the provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering the Actions product or service, or any elements of the Actions product or service, for commercial purposes; any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Actions as a content delivery network or as part of a serverless application, but a low benefit Action could be ok if itâ€™s also low burden); or if using GitHub-hosted runners, any other activity unrelated to the production, testing, deployment, or publication of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Actions are used. In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Actions, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Actions. Misuse of GitHub Actions may result in termination of jobs, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Actions, disabling of repositories created to run Actions in a way that violates these Terms, or in some cases, suspension or termination of your GitHub account. Use for Development and Testing You may only access and use GitHub Actions to develop and test your application(s). Only one licensed user may access a virtual machine provided by Actions at any time. Authorized Developer You appoint GitHub as your authorized developer with respect to Apple software included in Actions. GitHub is responsible for complying with the terms for any such software included in Actions and will keep confidential any confidential information of Apple accessed as part of Actions. Third Party Repository Service Access If you grant GitHub access to your third-party repository service account(s), you authorize GitHub to scan the account(s), including the contents of your Public and Private Repositories, for purposes of providing GitHub Actions. Self-Hosted Runners on GitHub Actions If you use self-hosted runners, you have the ability to turn off automatic updates but GitHub reserves the right to override your choice for critical security updates. Advanced Security GitHub makes extra security features available to customers under an Advanced Security license. These features include code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review. The Advanced Security documentation provides more details. Advanced Security is licensed on a "Unique Committer" basis. A "Unique Committer" is a licensed user of GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, or GitHub AE, who has made a commit in the last 90 days to any repository with any GitHub Advanced Security functionality activated. You must acquire a GitHub Advanced Security User license for each of your Unique Committers. You may only use GitHub Advanced Security on codebases that are developed by or for you. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud users, some Advanced Security features also require the use of GitHub Actions. Advisory Database The GitHub Advisory Database allows you to browse or search for vulnerabilities that affect open source projects on GitHub. License Grant to Us We need the legal right to submit your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database into public domain datasets such as the National Vulnerability Database and to license the GitHub Advisory Database under open terms for use by security researchers, the open source community, industry, and the public. You agree to release your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database under the Creative Commons Zero license. License to the GitHub Advisory Database The GitHub Advisory Database is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. The attribution term may be fulfilled by linking to the GitHub Advisory Database at https://github.com/advisories or to individual GitHub Advisory Database records used, prefixed by https://github.com/advisories. Codespaces Note: The github.dev service, available by pressing . on a repo or navigating directly to github.dev, is governed by GitHub's Beta Terms of service. GitHub Codespaces enables you to develop code directly from your browser using the code within your GitHub repository. Codespaces and any elements of the Codespaces service may not be used in violation of the Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policies. Additionally, Codespaces should not be used for: cryptomining; using our servers to disrupt, or to gain or to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any service, device, data, account or network (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program); the provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering Codespaces or any elements of Codespaces for commercial purposes; any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Codespaces as a content delivery network, as part of a serverless application, or to host any kind of production-facing application); or any other activity unrelated to the development or testing of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Codespaces is initiated. In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Codespaces, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Codespaces. Misuse of GitHub Codespaces may result in termination of your access to Codespaces, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Codespaces, or the disabling of repositories created to run Codespaces in a way that violates these Terms. Codespaces allows you to load extensions from the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace (â€œMarketplace Extensionsâ€?) for use in your development environment, for example, to process the programming languages that your code is written in. Marketplace Extensions are licensed under their own separate terms of use as noted in the Visual Studio Marketplace, and the terms of use located at https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU. GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Marketplace Extensions and is not liable for actions of third-party authors of Marketplace Extensions that are granted access to Your Content. Codespaces also allows you to load software into your environment through devcontainer features. Such software is provided under the separate terms of use accompanying it. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk. The generally available version of Codespaces is not currently available for U.S. government customers. U.S. government customers may continue to use the Codespaces Beta Preview under separate terms. See Beta Preview terms.
