(Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Â  Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Â  Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the worldâ€™s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barberâ€™s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming â€œunstuck in time.â€? An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegutâ€™s writingâ€”the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive witâ€”that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim Oâ€™Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegutâ€™s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as â€œthe kind of writer who made peopleâ€”young people especiallyâ€”want to write.â€? George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be â€œthe great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.â€? Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own eraâ€™s uncertainties. â€œPoignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.â€?â€”The Boston Globe $8.99 Moon Knight (2014-): Dead Will Rise Vol 2, #7-12 Â‘Season Two' begins with a new creative team - and a blackout!

Now she takes us through the defining moments in her life that led to the creation of Nanette and her powerful decision to tell the truthâ€”no matter the cost. â€œHannah is a Promethean force, a revolutionary talent. This hilarious, touching, and sometimes tragic book is all about where her fires were lit.â€?â€”Emma Thompson ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022â€”Entertainment Weekly, PopSugar â€œThere is nothing stronger than a broken woman who has rebuilt herself,â€?Â Hannah Gadsby declared in her show Nanette, a scorching critique of the way society conducts public debates about marginalized communities. When it premiered on Netflix, it left audiences captivated by her blistering honesty and her singular ability to take them from rolling laughter to devastated silence. Ten Steps to Nanette continues Gadsbyâ€™s tradition of confounding expectations and norms, properly introducing us to one of the most explosive, formative voices of our time. Gadsby grew upÂ as the youngest of five childrenÂ in an isolated town in Tasmania, whereÂ homosexuality was illegal until 1997. She perceived her childhood as safe and â€œnormal,â€? but as she gained an awareness of her burgeoning queerness, the outside world began to undermine the â€œvulnerably thin veneerâ€? of her existence. After moving to mainland Australia and receiving aÂ degreeÂ in art history, Gadsby found herself adrift, working itinerant jobs and enduring years of isolation punctuated by homophobic and sexual violence. At age twenty-seven, without a home or the ability to imagine her own future, she was urged by a friend to enter aÂ stand-upÂ competition. She won, and so began her career in comedy.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Gadsby became well known for her self-deprecating, autobiographical humor that made her the butt of her own jokes. But in 2015, as Australia debated the legality of same-sex marriage, Gadsby started to question this mode of storytelling, beginning work on a show that would become â€œthe most-talked-about, written-about, shared-about comedy act in yearsâ€? (The New York Times).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Harrowing and hilarious, Ten Steps to Nanette traces Gadsbyâ€™s growth as a queer person, to her ever-evolving relationship with comedy,Â andÂ her struggle with late-in-life diagnoses of autism and ADHD, finallyÂ arriving atÂ the backbone of Nanette: the renouncement of self-deprecation, the rejection of misogyny, and the moral significance of truth-telling. $16.99 A Relative Murder Book 4 Even the closest families have secrets hidden away.

Accompanied by Puck the Elf, more an annoyance than a companion, Guts relentlessly follows a dark, bloodstained path that leads only to death...or vengeance. $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 2 The evil Count uses his dark powers to transform a defeated guard captain into an inhuman horror to combat Guts, the Black Swordsman. Puck, Gutsâ€™ pint-sized fairy sidekick, is captured when he attempts to stop an old doctorâ€™s execution, and he is given as a gift to the countâ€™s daughter, a sweet girl in a gilded cage, imprisoned by her father in her own room. Guts, determined to make mincemeat of the Count, assaults the castle and carves a swath of blood-soaked destruction through the Countâ€™s minions. Face-to-face with the Black Swordsman at last, the Count reveals his true form, and even Gutsâ€™ super-sized sword may not be big enough to contend with this demonic monstrosity! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 3 Guts, the feared Black Swordsman, finishes his desperate battle with the monstrous Count, cutting and blasting him to gory scraps when the presence of the Count's daughter makes the monster hesitate. But Guts won't even have the time to clean his gigantic sword when the Count's dying pleas activate the Behelit, summoning the five God Hands, demon lords of immeasurable power. Guts' journey so far has been a long road of pain and death, but that's a walk in the park compared to fighting his way out of Hell itself! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 7 Two feudal kingdoms, Midland and Chuder, battle for supremacy in what will become the final clash in a century-long struggle. Spearheading the Midland forces is the Band of the Hawk, a legendary cadre of elite mercenaries led by the charismatic Griffith and with the fearless Guts as its berserker champion. The Hawks' ferocity, courage, and fearsome skills - not to mention Guts' enormous broadsword - are just what Midland needs to turn the bloody tide, but during the fray, Guts and Griffith's most trusted lieutenant, Casca, fall together from a cliff into a raging river. Miraculously, both barely survive, and Guts tends to Casca's wounds as she tells of having her life saved by Griffith, her induction into the Band of the Hawk, and her deep feelings toward Griffith. She even seems to finally be warming up to the grim Guts. But this greeting-card moment won't last long, for Chuder warriors are on the prowl, and the only greetings they carry are on the points of their spears! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 4 Now that the evil Count has been killed and dragged to Hell by the demon lords of the Godhand, Guts, the Black Swordsman, hooks up with his former benefactor, the mercenary Gambino. But itâ€™s a deadly reunion, one that nearly takes Gutsâ€™ life. The following years see Guts wandering from battlefield to battlefield, where his awesome skills as a slayer catch the eye of both warring parties, including the legendary Griffith, warrior leader of the Band of the Hawk, who is eager to test his combat skills against those of the Black Swordsman. As usual, anytime that Guts is involved there will be hell to pay! $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 9 Griffith, charismatic leader of the elite mercenary Band of the Hawk, has seen better days. His fearless champion, Guts, has left the Band, defeating Griffith in personal combat as his ticket out. With his judgment clouded by this unthinkable humiliation, Griffith eases his pain in the arms of the daughter of Midlandâ€™s king. But the King doesnâ€™t take kindly to an employee picking the royal flowers, and the next stop for Griffith is the dungeon and the torture rack! Without Griffith and Guts, the Hawks become easy prey for Midlandâ€™s army, and the AWOL Guts may be the only answer to the Hawks' â€” and Griffithâ€™s â€” lethal problems. $12.99$3.99 The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated: Expanded and Updated, With Over 100 New Pages of Cutting-Edge Content.

The Hawksâ€™ tortured and mutilated former leader, Griffith, has used the accursed Crimson Behelit to open the gates to a shadowy realm of unspeakable horrors, the realm of the demon lords of the Godhand, who are willing to transform Griffith into a being of terrible power and majesty as long as Griffith is willing to give up his former command as sacrifices in the Invocation of Doom. But nobody takes down the Hawks without a fight, and their berserker champion, Guts, will take on anything Hell can throw at him in order to save his lover, Casca, from the sordid violations that only Hell can offer. $12.99$3.99 Berserk Vol 14 The once unbeatable Band of the Hawk is smashed, and their former leader, Griffith, has made an unholy pact with the demon lords of the Godhand, sacrificing his former troops to resurrect his crippled body and ascend to stand in power beside these profane gods. The Invocation of Doom has unleashed a plague of unspeakable horrors upon the earth, and the first battle not only shatters the Hawks, but the hand of their champion, Guts, and the mind of their captain and Gutsâ€™ lover, Casca.

While in a kingâ€™s employ, the attraction between the kingâ€™s daughter and Griffith and the growing favor of the king towards the Hawk leader raises the hackles of the kingâ€™s jealous son, who plots to have Griffith summarily assassinated. But if the plot fails, the kingâ€™s son will likely have to deal with Guts and his titanic broadsword, and the results of such confrontations are rarely pretty... or easy to clean up. $12.99$3.99 Â©2022 GoogleSite Terms of ServicePrivacyDevelopersAbout Google Play|Location: CanadaLanguage: English By purchasing this item, you are transacting with Google Payments and agreeing to the Google Payments Terms of Service and Privacy Notice.
