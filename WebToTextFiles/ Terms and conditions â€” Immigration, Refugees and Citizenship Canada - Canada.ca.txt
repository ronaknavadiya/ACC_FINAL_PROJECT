The following terms and conditions of the Government of Canada also apply: Using files located on non-Government of Canada servers Providing content in Canadaâ€™s official languages Linking to non-Government of Canada websites Our commitment to accessibility On this page Privacy notices Improving your experience on our website Ownership and usage of content provided on this site Social media Questions and media requests Privacy notices We are committed to providing websites that respect the privacy of visitors. This privacy notice summarizes the privacy policy and practices for our online activities. All personal information collected by this institution is governed by the Privacy Act. This means that you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information. Any questions, comments, concerns or complaints you may have regarding the administration of the Privacy Act, and privacy policies regarding our web presence may be directed to our Access to Information and Privacy Division. If you are not satisfied with our response to your privacy concern, contact the Office of the Privacy Commissioner by telephone at 1-800-282-1376. Your privacy and the Internet The nature of the Internet is such that web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a website, including the visitorâ€™s Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, we consider the IP address to be personal information, particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when visitor requests a web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of the visit. Unless otherwise noted, we do not automatically gather any specific information from you, such as your name, telephone number or email address. We would obtain this type of information only if you supply it to us, for example, by email or by filling in a contact form. In such cases, how your personal information is handled will be provided in a Personal Information Collection Statement. In cases where services are provided by organizations outside of the Government of Canada, such as social media platforms or mobile applications, IP addresses may be recorded by the web server of the third-party service provider. Communicating with us If you choose to send us an email or complete a feedback form online, your personal information is used in order to respond to your inquiry. The information you provide will only be shared with another government institution if your inquiry relates to that institution. We do not use the information to create individual profiles nor does it disclose the information to anyone other than to those in the federal government who need to provide you with a response. Any disclosure of your personal information is in accordance with the Privacy Act. Personal information from emails or completed feedback forms is collected pursuant to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Citizenship Act. Such information may be used for statistical, evaluation and reporting purposes and is included in Personal Information Bank Public Communications (PSU 914). Signing up for our email updates If you complete an online form to subscribe to our email updates, weâ€™ll use the information you provide to send you the updates. Providing your personal information is voluntary and is only needed if you request to receive this information. We wonâ€™t use your personal information for any other purpose unless specified otherwise at the point of email entry. Personal information is collected pursuant to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Citizenship Act, the Financial Administration Act and in accordance with the Policy on Communications and Federal Identity. The Privacy Act gives individuals the right of access to, protection and correction of their personal information. The standard Personal Information Bank PSU 914 (entitled Public Communications) further describes the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information. If youâ€™re not satisfied with how we handle your personal information, you may file a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.

Improving your experience on our website Digital markers (including cookies) A digital marker is a resource created by the visitorsâ€™ browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the website. Examples of digital markers are â€œcookiesâ€? or HTML5 web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows: they allow a website to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the site; they track what information is viewed on a site which helps website administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking for. We use sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of its website. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with our web server. The digital markers used do not allow IRCC to identify individuals. Web analytics Web analytics is the term used for the collection, analysis, measurement and reporting of data about Web traffic and visits, for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage. Information in digital markers may be used for the purpose of Web analytics to remember your online interactions with our website. When you visit our website, we collect the following information: IP address of the device (which is not stored or retained in a format that can be used to identify a visitor) type of browser type of operating system the date and time of the visit pages visited and documents downloaded This personal information is not used for decision-making processes about an individual or to profile individual visitors to Canada.ca. We use services from 2 third-party service providers, Adobe Systems Inc. (Adobe Analytics) and Google Inc. (Google Analytics), to improve our website. To protect information about visitors to our website, we use a feature from each service provider that hides part or all of the IP address of the visitor before it is stored. These service providers are based in the United States of America, which means that the personal information collected is transmitted outside of Canada and may be subject to U.S. laws, including the U.S. Patriot Act. In addition, Adobe and Google operate servers in other countries on which the Web analytics data may be processed. Consequently, the data may be subject to the governing legislation of the country where it is processed. For Adobe Analytics, the Government of Canada has specified that personal information can only be stored on servers in Canada, the U.S., the European Union, Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.

Protecting the security of our websites We employ software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. This software receives and records the IP address of the computer that has contacted our website, the date and time of the visit and the pages visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected. This information is collected pursuant to section 161 of the Financial Administration Act.
